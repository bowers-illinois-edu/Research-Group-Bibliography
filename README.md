This is a place to store bibliography databases for sharing. I've
started it with my one-file-to-rule-them-all database.

This file, big.bib, includes local urls generated by BibDesk pointing
to many of the papers referenced in the database. I don't think this
is a problem, but those urls will only work on my computer. We can't
share those papers publically, but we could share them in our research
group somehow. I am open to ideas about this.

If you fork and add, please contribute back to grow the database.
