	Abstract = {Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the
		  extent to which it characterizes current research is
		  unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and
		  correlational studies published in three psychology
		  journals using high-powered designs and original materials
		  when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude
		  of original effects, representing a substantial decline.
		  Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically
		  significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had
		  statistically significant results; 47{\%} of original
		  effect sizes were in the 95{\%} confidence interval of the
		  replication effect size; 39{\%} of effects were
		  subjectively rated to have replicated the original result;
		  and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining
		  original and replication results left 68{\%} with
		  statistically significant effects. Correlational tests
		  suggest that replication success was better predicted by
		  the strength of original evidence than by characteristics
		  of the original and replication teams.},

	Abstract = {Over the past year, Chinese newspapers have been filled
		  with commentary on changes in the Vietnamese polity, which
		  they deem to be more democratic. The discussion has been so
		  intense that Chinese officials actually banned further
		  discussion of the topic. The discussions pose an intriguing
		  puzzle for comparative politics; as none of the indices of
		  governance currently available are able to adequately
		  account for the variation that Chinese journalists deem to
		  be so important. The inability of these scales to capture
		  within-typology variation is an important lacuna in our
		  understanding of the behavior of authoritarian regimes.
		  Using this puzzle as our starting point, we focus our
		  analytical lens on accountability mechanisms within the two
		  single-party states, finding significant differences in the
		  distribution of powers within the party apparatus, between
		  party and government, and with government institutions. We
		  also document increasing separation on the openness and
		  competitiveness of elections for the Central Committee and
		  national parliaments. Our findings open up important
		  avenues for research on regime durability and democratic
		  transition.},

	Abstract = {Many of our inherited civic institutions are dead or
		  dying. We need an ambitious reform program to revive
		  democratic life. This essay advances a four-pronged
		  ``citizenship agenda'': (1) a campaign finance initiative
		  granting each voter fifty ``patriot dollars'' to fund
		  candidates and political parties of his or her choice; (2)
		  a proposal for a new national holiday, Deliberation Day,
		  held before each national election, enabling citizens to
		  deliberate on the merits of rival candidates; (3) a system
		  of federally financed electronic news-vouchers to permit
		  professional journalism to survive the destruction of its
		  traditional business model; and (4) a new form of
		  citizenship inheritance, which provides $80,000 to all
		  Americans as they start off life as adults. Working with
		  collaborators, I have developed each of these initiatives
		  at book length. This essay suggests how the ``citizenship
		  agenda'' yields a whole that is larger than the sum of its

@article{agrawal1999,
	Abstract = {The poor conservation outcomes that followed decades of
		  intrusive resource management strategies and planned
		  development have forced policy makers and scholars to
		  reconsider the role of community in resource use and
		  conservation. In a break from previous work on development
		  which considered communities a hindrance to progressive
		  social change, current writings champion the role of
		  community in bringing about decentralization, meaningful
		  participation, and conservation. But despite its recent
		  popularity, the concept of community is rarely defined or
		  carefully examined by those concerned with resource use and
		  management. We seek to redress this omission by
		  investigating 'community' in work concerning resource
		  conservation and management. We explore the conceptual
		  origins of the community, and the ways the term has been
		  deployed in writings on resource use. We then analyze those
		  aspects of community most important to advocates for
		  community's role in resource management - community as a
		  small spatial unit, as a homogeneous social structure, and
		  as shared norms - and indicate the weaknesses of these
		  approaches. Finally, we suggest a more political approach:
		  community must be examined in the context of development
		  and conservation by focusing on the multiple interests and
		  actors within communities, on how these actors influence
		  decision-making, and on the internal and external
		  institutions that shape the decision-making process. A
		  focus on institutions rather than 'community' is likely to
		  be more fruitful for those interested in community-based
		  natural resource management.},

	Abstract = { Exact small-sample methods for discrete data use
		  probability distributions that do not depend on unknown
		  parameters. However, they are conservative inferentially:
		  the actual error probabilities for tests and confidence
		  intervals are bounded above by the nominal level. This
		  article surveys ways of reducing or even eliminating the
		  conservatism. Fuzzy inference is a recent innovation that
		  enables one to achieve the error probability exactly. We
		  present a simple way of conducting fuzzy inference for
		  discrete one-parameter exponential family distributions. In
		  practice, most scientists would find this approach
		  unsuitable yet might be disappointed by the conservatism of
		  ordinary exact methods. Thus, we recommend using exact
		  small-sample distributions but with inferences based on the
		  mid-P value. This approach can be motivated by fuzzy
		  inference, it is less conservative than standard exact
		  methods, yet usually it does well in terms of achieving
		  desired error probabilities. We illustrate for inferences
		  about the binomial parameter.},

		  delivery, of different approaches to decentralization,
		  based on relationships of accountability between different
		  actors in the delivery chain. Moving from a model of
		  central provision to that of decentralization to local
		  governments introduces a new relationship of
		  accountability--- between national and local
		  policymakers---while altering existing relationships, such
		  as that between citizens and elected politicians. Only by
		  examining how these relationships change can we understand
		  why decentralization can, and sometimes cannot, lead to
		  better service delivery. In particular, the various
		  instruments of decentralization---fiscal, administrative,
		  regulatory, market, and financial---can affect the
		  incentives facing service providers, even though they
		  relate only to local policymakers. Likewise, and perhaps
		  more significantly, the incentives facing local and
		  national politicians can have a profound effect on the
		  provision of local services. Finally, the process of
		  implementing decentralization can be as important as the
		  design of the system in influencing service delivery
		  outcomes.},

	Abstract = {This article explores how the significance of ethnic
		  identity can vary within a stable population, using caste
		  among Muslims in Hyderabad, India as a case study. While
		  some Hyderabadi Muslims are still embedded in ethnic
		  networks, most now experience ethnicity as elective and do
		  not rely on a corporate caste group for their social
		  connections. This reflects a decline in the value of caste
		  identities, which no longer provide economic or political
		  resources. Increasingly, Muslims seek status through
		  education, profession, or income. Thus, most Muslims in
		  Hyderabad experience caste membership, identity, and
		  networks in a weakened or attenuated way.},

	Abstract = {Most studies of migration that ask why and how people
		  migrate examine economic rationales and the network
		  connections of migrants. In this article, I explore one
		  understudied aspect of the migration process, the `culture
		  of migration', using data gathered from field research in
		  Hyderabad, India. Hyderabad is a city with substantial
		  capital investment, especially from IT companies, and is an
		  excellent site to examine how the desire to migrate remains
		  salient in spite of the immigration of capital to the
		  migrants' home setting, resulting in increased job
		  opportunities at home, at least for professionals.
		  Additionally, greater restrictions have been placed by
		  Persian Gulf states on migrant labourers, resulting in
		  decreased opportunities abroad. I argue that it is the
		  culture of migration among Hyderabadi Muslim professionals
		  and labourers that promotes migration to the US and Saudi
		  Arabia, even though opportunities at home are greater for
		  some, and opportunities abroad are more restricted for
		  others. I further argue that this culture of migration
		  helps to shape the effects of remittances on status
		  relations and marriage patterns among Muslims in Hyderabad,
		  which further promotes migration abroad.},

	Abstract = {Alternative food initiatives are appearing in many places.
		  Observers suggest that they share a political agenda: to
		  oppose the structures that coordinate and globalize the
		  current food system and to create alternative systems of
		  food production that are environmentally sustainable,
		  economically viable, and socially just. This paper examines
		  the potential of these initiatives through the lens of the
		  concepts of `alternative and oppositional' social movements
		  and `militant particularism and global ambition' developed
		  by Raymond Williams and David Harvey. The three sections of
		  this paper review (1) the current discussion of common
		  themes and strategies in agrifood initiatives within the
		  academic literature; (2) the history of these initiatives
		  in California; and (3) results of our interviews with 37
		  current leaders of California organizations. We suggest
		  that further understanding these initiatives, and success
		  in the goals of the initiatives themselves, requires us to
		  look past their similarities to examine their differences.
		  These differences are related to the social forms and
		  relations that have been established in the places from
		  which these initiatives arise. `Social justice,' in
		  particular, may be difficult to construct at a `local'
		  scale.},

	Abstract = {Dozens of countries have decentralized at least part of
		  their natural resource policies over the last two decades.
		  Despite the length of time that these policy experiments
		  have been in force, there is little agreement about their
		  effectiveness. We argue that part of this ambivalence stems
		  from three limitations of extant studies, suggesting that
		  future studies of decentralized natural resource governance
		  should consider a combination of 1) variation in the local
		  institutional context, 2) the fit between the reform and
		  other public policies, and 3) more adequate outcome
		  measures for decentralized resource governance. After
		  developing such an approach, we posit that varying forest
		  conditions depend on the moderating effects that local
		  institutions have on the socioe- conomic and biophysical
		  drivers of environmental change. Analyzing data from inter-
		  views and remotely sensed images from 30 municipalities in
		  the Bolivian lowlands, we find that the local institutional
		  performance affects unauthorized deforestation directly and
		  indirectly, but detect no effects on either permitted or
		  total deforestation.},

	Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to
		  proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain
		  of applicability of most small molecule and
		  protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small
		  molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of
		  19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve
		  pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for
		  flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses
		  was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit
		  solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among
		  the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate
		  (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms)
		  increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to
		  58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring
		  protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein
		  structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently
		  developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for
		  these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster.
		  Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an
		  unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case,
		  40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the
		  results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is
		  most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and
		  number of formal charges, defining a domain of
		  applicability for this approach.},

		  the Con out of Econometrics,'' empirical microeconomics has
		  experienced a credibility revolution. While Leamer's
		  suggested remedy, sensitivity analysis, has played a role
		  in this, we argue that the primary engine driving
		  improvement has been a focus on the quality of empirical
		  research designs. The advantages of a good research design
		  are perhaps most easily apparent in research using random
		  assignment. We begin with an overview of Leamer's 1983
		  critique and his proposed remedies. We then turn to the key
		  factors we see contributing to improved empirical work,
		  including the availability of more and better data, along
		  with advances in theoretical econometric understanding, but
		  especially the fact that research design has moved front
		  and center in much of empirical micro. We offer a brief

	Abstract = {Recent empirical studies on American elections suggest
		  that campaigns provide voters with the necessary
		  information to make reasoned voting decisions.
		  Specifically, campaigns help voters leam about the
		  electoral relevance of 'fundamental variables', such as the
		  economy and party stances, that have been consistently
		  shown to predict electoral outcomes. Do these findings
		  generalize beyond the American case? This article uses
		  cross-national survey data in order to subject this thesis
		  to a more comprehensive test. The analysis provides further
		  support for the hypothesis that campaigns 'enlighten'
		  voters as the election draws near. Moreover, the article
		  shows that some voters leam more from campaigns than
		  others. Campaign effects are more pronounced among
		  individuals with low political sophistication and those
		  living in party list systems. Implications for future
		  research are explored, suggesting a ripe research agenda

		  distinctions to their voting decisions. Citizens are
		  expected to sanction politicians for those policy decisions
		  over which their level of government has responsibility.
		  This paper draws on work in both political and social
		  psychology to develop a theoretical framework consistent
		  with the federalist view of democratic representation to
		  explain how people make voting decisions. Individuals who
		  were able to vote in elections at all three levels of
		  government (national, state, and local) in 2002 were
		  surveyed, allowing a full test of the federalist voting
		  model. Findings show that while citizens do make
		  distinctions among levels of government when evaluating
		  issues, they only link these distinctions to their voting
		  decisions if those issue attitudes are highly accessible.
		  Implications for democratic representation and future
		  research are discussed.},

	Abstract = {When evaluating political candidates, citizens can draw on
		  partisan stereotypes and use partisan cues to make
		  inferences about the candidates' issue positions without
		  undertaking a costly information search. As long as
		  candidates adopt policy positions that are congruent with
		  partisan stereotypes, partisan cues can help citizens make
		  an accurate voting decision with limited information.
		  However, if candidates take counter-stereotypical
		  positions, it is incumbent upon citizens to recognize it
		  and adjust their evaluations accordingly. Using the
		  dual-processing framework, I hypothesize about the
		  conditions under which individuals reduce their reliance on
		  partisan cues and scrutinize counter-stereotypical
		  messages, and test these hypotheses with experimental data
		  collected from a nationally representative sample of

		  salience of the issue and the political awareness of the
		  message recipient. The article concludes with a discussion

	Abstract = {Interference between units may pose a threat to unbiased
		  causal inference in randomized controlled experiments.
		  Although the assumption of no interference is often
		  necessary for causal inference, few options are available
		  for testing this assumption. This article presents an ex
		  post method for detecting interference between units in
		  randomized experiments. With a test statistic of the
		  analyst's choice, a conditional randomization test allows
		  for the calculation of the exact significance level of the
		  causal dependence of outcomes on the treatment status of
		  other units. The robustness of the method is demonstrated
		  through simulation studies. Moreover, using this method,
		  interference between units is detected in a field
		  experiment designed to assess the effect of mailings on
		  voter turnout in a U.S. primary election.},

	Abstract = {Do domestic election observers deter electoral fraud? And
		  under what conditions do political par- ties respond to the
		  presence of observers to negate their impact? We address
		  these questions by studying observers' effects on two
		  markers of fraud --- overvoting (more votes cast than
		  registered voters) and unnaturally high levels of turnout
		  --- during Ghana's 2012 presidential elections. Our
		  randomized saturation experimental design allows us to
		  estimate observers' causal effects and to identify how
		  political parties strategically respond to observers. We
		  show that observers signif- icantly reduce overvoting and
		  suspicious turnout at polling stations to which they are
		  deployed. We also find that political parties successfully
		  relocate fraud from observed to unobserved stations in
		  their historical strongholds, where they enjoy social
		  penetration and political competition is low, whereas they
		  are not able to do so in politically competitive
		  constituencies. The findings have implications for
		  understanding political party behavior and the effects of
		  governance interventions},

	Abstract = {As of 2007, 29 developing countries had some type of
		  Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program in place, with many
		  others planning or piloting one. However, the evidence base
		  needed by a government to decide how to design a new CCT
		  program is severely limited in a number of critical
		  dimensions. We present one-year schooling impacts from a
		  CCT experiment among teenage girls and young women in
		  Malawi, which was designed to address these shortcomings:
		  conditionality status, size of separate transfers to the
		  schoolgirl and the parent, and village-level saturation of
		  treatment were all independently randomized. We find that
		  the program had large impacts on school attendance: the
		  re-enrollment rate among those who had already dropped out
		  of school before the start of the program increased by two
		  and a half times and the dropout rate among those in school
		  at baseline decreased from 11\% to 6\%. These impacts were,
		  on average, similar in the conditional and the
		  unconditional treatment arms. While most schooling outcomes
		  examined here were unresponsive to variation in the size of
		  the transfer to the parents, higher transfers given
		  directly to the schoolgirls were associated with
		  significantly improved school attendance and progress --
		  but only if the transfers were conditional on school
		  attendance. We find no spillover effects within treatment
		  communities after the first year of program implementation.
		  Policymakers looking to design cost-effective cash transfer
		  programs targeted towards young women should note the
		  relative insensitivity of these short-term program impacts
		  with respect to conditionality and total transfer size.},

		  reason to believe that such programs can affect other
		  outcomes, such as the sexual behavior of their young
		  beneficiaries. Zomba Cash Transfer Program is a randomized
		  ongoing CCT intervention targeting young women in Malawi
		  that provides incentives (in the form of school fees and
		  cash transfers) to current schoolgirls and recent dropouts
		  to stay in or return to school. An average offer of US\$10/
		  month conditional on satisfactory school attendance -- plus
		  direct payment of secondary school fees -- led to
		  significant declines in early marriage, teenage pregnancy,
		  and self-reported sexual activity among program
		  beneficiaries after just one year of program
		  implementation. For program beneficiaries who were out of
		  school at baseline, the probability of getting married and
		  becoming pregnant declined by more than 40 and 30\%,
		  respectively. In addition, the incidence of the onset of
		  sexual activity was 38\% lower among all program
		  beneficiaries than the control group. Overall, these
		  results suggest that CCT programs not only serve as useful
		  tools for improving school attendance but may also reduce

	Abstract = {Social sanctioning is widely considered a successful
		  strategy to promote cooperation among humans. In situations
		  in which individual and collective interests are at odds,
		  incentives to free-ride induce individuals to refrain from
		  contributing to public goods provision. Experimental
		  evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed
		  with sanctioning powers, conditional cooperators can
		  discipline defectors, thus leading to greater levels of
		  cooperation. However, extant evidence is based on peer
		  punishment institutions, whereas in complex societies,
		  systems of control are often centralized: for instance, we
		  do not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the
		  police do. Here we show the effect of centralized
		  sanctioning and legitimate authority on cooperation. We
		  designed an adaptation of the public goods game in which
		  sanctioning power is given to a single monitor, and we
		  experimentally manipulated the process by which the monitor
		  is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study,
		  we conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1,543
		  Ugandan farmers from 50 producer cooperatives. This
		  research provides evidence of the effectiveness of
		  centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal effect
		  of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more
		  responsive to the authority of an elected monitor than a
		  randomly chosen monitor. Our essay contributes to the
		  literature on the evolution of cooperation by introducing
		  the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies,
		  cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of
		  selection and reciprocity among peers, but also by the
		  legitimacy that certain actors derive from their position
		  in the social hierarchy.},

	Abstract = {The role of deliberation among citizens to determine and
		  forge agreement on policy is often seen as a crucial
		  feature of democratic government. This paper provides the
		  first large-N empirical evidence on the credibility of
		  voice in a deliberative democracy in an non-laboratory
		  setting, using a unique dataset collected from transcripts
		  of deliberation that occurred between January and September
		  2003 in 127 functioning village parliaments (gram sabhas)
		  in Southern India. We exploit a natural experiment in the
		  arrangement of India's state borders across ethnolinguistic
		  lines that led exogenously to increased caste fragmentation
		  and a reduced degree of consensus on public goods
		  priorities. We then examine the patterns of deliberation.
		  We reject the presence of pure cheap talk in both
		  heterogeneous and homogeneous villages. Instead, we show
		  that in caste-fragmented South Indian villages, where there
		  is less village-wide agreement on the relative importance
		  of different public goods, the probability of an
		  individual's highest priority being discussed increases as
		  the household becomes more credible: its preferences
		  approach the pivotal agent in a pure representative
		  democracy, the median household. These effects are lower in
		  ethnically homogeneous villages where there is greater
		  consensus on the prioritization of public goods. Taken
		  together, our results suggest that India's village
		  parliaments, rather than being mere talking shops or being
		  entirely captured by elites, seem instead to be both
		  democratically representative and to be assigning roles to
		  credible agents in their deliberative processes. ?? 2012.},

	Abstract = {Two decades of empirical evaluation have shown that
		  corruption has a negative impact on economic growth,
		  political stability, judicial effectiveness,
		  democratization, educational attainment, and equality of
		  income. However, corruption exists, persists, and varies
		  significantly by culture. Lab studies have recently come to
		  the forefront in identifying both the incentives and
		  disincentives for corrupt behavior. However, lab studies on
		  culture and corruption have led to some puzzling,
		  contradictory results. This paper begins with a discussion
		  of non-experimental work in this area, and evaluates the
		  experimental findings in the context of earlier
		  research.The authors sketch out the channels through which
		  culture interacts with corruption (through institutions and
		  social norms), and argue that discrepancies in experimental
		  results may be due to differences in design (including
		  repetition or unobserved variation in beliefs) or to
		  differences in the response to punishment across societies.
		  In addition to exploring design-based reasons for previous
		  contradictory findings, avenues for future research
		  include: behavioral responses to different types of
		  externalities; replicating results in different countries;
		  and utilizing the lab to formulate effective
		  anti-corruption measures},

	Abstract = {Education policy has recently focused on improving
		  accountability and incentives of public providers for
		  actual learning outcomes, often with school-based reward
		  programmes for high performers. The Learning Guarantee
		  Programme in Karnataka, India, is prominent among such
		  efforts, providing cash transfers to government schools
		  that achieve learning at specified high levels. This study
		  examines whether schools that self-selected into the
		  incentive programme are different than those that did not.
		  The answer has important implications for how to evaluate
		  the impact of such a programme. Although we find no
		  significant differences in resources and characteristics,
		  we do find significant and substantial differences in test
		  scores prior to selection into the programme, with better
		  performing schools more likely to opt-in. These findings
		  also provide insight into how incentive-based programmes
		  that focus on levels of (rather than changes in)
		  achievement can exacerbate inequality in education. Failing
		  schools, since they are more likely to opt-out of incentive
		  programmes, are likely to require other targeted programmes
		  in order to improve. In addition, our findings reinforce
		  the value of randomised controlled trials to evaluate
		  incentive programmes since evaluations that rely on
		  matching schools based on resources (if, for instance,
		  pre-programme test scores are unavailable) will be biased
		  if resources poorly predict test scores.},

		  these problems we use an economic experiment to investigate
		  the determinants of corrupt behaviour. We focus on three
		  aspects of behaviour: (i) embezzlement by public servants;
		  (ii) monitoring effort by designated monitors; and, (iii)
		  voting by community members when provided with an
		  opportunity to select a monitor. The experiment allows us

		  when observability (associated with the risk of being
		  caught and sanctioned) is high, and when service providers
		  face an elected rather than randomly selected monitor.
		  Monitors put more effort into monitoring when they face
		  re-election and when the public servant receives a higher
		  wage. Communities re-elect monitors who put more effort

	Abstract = {The widespread presence of local conflict characterizes
		  many developing countries such as Indonesia. Outbreaks of
		  violent conflict not only have direct costs for lives,
		  livelihoods, and material property, but may also have the
		  potential to escalate further. Recent studies on
		  large-scale ``headline'' conflicts have tended to exclude
		  the systematic consideration of local conflict, in large
		  part due to the absence of representative data at low
		  levels of geographic specification. This paper is a first
		  attempt to correct for that. We evaluate a unique dataset
		  compiled by the Indonesian government, the periodic Village
		  Potential Statistics (PODES), which seeks to map conflict
		  across all of Indonesia's 69,000 villages/neighborhoods.
		  The data confirm that conflict is prevalent beyond well
		  publicized ``conflict regions,'' and that it can be
		  observed across the archipelago. The data report largely
		  violent conflict in 7.1 percent of Indonesia's lowest
		  administrative tier (rural desa and urban kelurahan).
		  Integrating examples from qualitative fieldwork, we assess
		  issues in the measurement of local conflict for
		  quantitative analysis, and adopt an empirical framework to
		  examine potential associations with poverty, inequality,
		  shocks, ethnic and religious diversity/inequality, and
		  community-level associational and security arrangements.
		  The quantitative analysis shows positive correlations
		  between local conflict and unemployment, inequality,
		  natural disasters, changes in sources of incomes, and
		  clustering of ethnic groups within villages. The
		  institutional variables indicate that the presence of
		  places of worship is associated with less conflict, while
		  the presence of religious groups and traditional culture
		  (adat) institutions are associated with conflict. We
		  conclude by suggesting future areas of research, notably on
		  the role of group inequality and inference, and suggest
		  ways to improve the measurement of conflict in the village

	Abstract = {Responding to conflict, in Indonesia and elsewhere,
		  requires an understanding of its distribution, forms, and
		  impacts. In this article, we outline an attempt to use
		  local newspaper monitoring to measure the levels and
		  impacts of violent conflict during the period 2001-2003 in
		  two Indonesian provinces (East Java and NTT). We also
		  assess variation in incidence, impact, and form across and
		  within areas. The study data suggest first that previous
		  research has vastly underestimated the impacts of violent
		  conflict in Indonesia. Comparing our data with those of the
		  previous attempt to use newspapers to map conflict in
		  Indonesia (by the UN Support Facility for Indonesian
		  Recovery [UNSFIR]), we find three times as many deaths from
		  collective violence. These differences are a function of
		  the level of news sources used, with provincial papers
		  picking up only a small proportion of deaths in our
		  research areas. Further, we argue that the impacts of
		  certain types of violence between individuals should be
		  included, leading to even higher figures. Second, our data
		  call into question the dictum that violence in Indonesia is
		  concentrated in a small number of regions. While there is
		  variation between districts, we record large impacts from
		  collective violence in areas not previously considered
		  conflict-prone. Third, substantial variations in conflict
		  form are found across regions, and these result in
		  different kinds of impacts. This underlines the importance
		  of consideration of the role of local factors in driving
		  conflicts and suggests that approaches must be tailored to
		  local conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that using local
		  newspapers to measure and analyze conflicts presents a
		  useful tool for understanding conflict in Indonesia. The
		  use of subprovincial news sources captures more accurate
		  estimates of conflict incidence than other methods, such as
		  provincial newspaper mapping or surveying. It can also
		  provide a basis for a deeper understanding of variations in
		  patterns of conflict across areas and provide insights into
		  how we might respond. [ABSTRACT FROM

		  the role of institutional arrangements and ecological
		  factors that facilitate the emergence and sustainability of
		  successful collective action in small-scale fishing
		  social-ecological systems. Using a modified logistic growth
		  function, we simulate how ecological factors (i.e. carrying
		  capacity) affect small-scale fishing communities with
		  varying degrees of institutional development (i.e.
		  timeliness to adopt new institutions and the degree to
		  which harvesting effort is reduced), in their ability to
		  avoid overexploitation. Our results show that strong and
		  timely institutions are necessary but not sufficient to
		  maintain sustainable harvests over time. The sooner
		  communities adopt institutions, and the stronger the
		  institutions they adopt, the more likely they are to
		  sustain the resource stock. Exactly how timely the
		  institutions must be adopted, and by what amount harvesting
		  effort must be diminished, depends on the ecological
		  carrying capacity of the species at the particular
		  location. Small differences in the carrying capacity

	Abstract = {Does emigration really drain human capital accumulation in

		  survey designed and conducted to answer this research
		  question. We analyze the case of Cape Verde, a country with
		  allegedly the highest 'brain drain' in Africa, despite a
		  marked record of income and human capital growth in recent
		  decades. We propose the first explicit test of 'brain
		  drain' arguments, according to which the prospects of own
		  future migration can positively impact educational
		  attainment. Our most conservative estimates using
		  individual specific variation in economic conditions at the
		  destination indicate that a 10 pp increase in the
		  probability of own future migration improves the
		  probability of completing intermediate secondary schooling
		  by nearly 4 pp for individuals who do not migrate before
		  age 16. These findings are robust to the choice of
		  instruments and econometric specification. Counterfactual
		  simulations point to significant human capital gains from

		  status. Using a randomized field experiment across 500
		  Afghan villages, we examine the effects of a development
		  program that mandates female participation.We find that
		  even in a highly conservative context like Afghanistan,
		  such initiatives improve outcomes specific to female
		  participation in some economic, social, and political
		  activities, including increased mobility and income
		  generation. They, however, produce no change in more
		  entrenched female roles linked to family decision-making or
		  in attitudes toward the general role of women in society.},

	Abstract = {Social scientists almost always use statistical models
		  positing the dependent variable as a global, linear
		  function of X, despite suspicions that the social and
		  political world is not so simple, or that our theories are
		  so strong. Generalized additive models (GAMs) let
		  researchers fit each independent variable with arbitrary
		  nonparametric functions, but subject to the constraint that
		  the nonparametric effects combine additively. In this way
		  GAMs strike a sensible balance between the flexibility of
		  nonparametric techniques and the ease of interpretation and
		  familiarity of linear regression. GAMs thus offer social
		  scientists a practical methodology for improving on the
		  extant practice of global linearity by default. We
		  reanalyze published work from several subfields of
		  political science, highlighting the strengths (and
		  limitations) of GAMs. We estimate non-linear marginal
		  effects in a regression analysis of incumbent reelection,
		  nonparametric duration dependence in an analysis of cabinet
		  duration, and within-dyad interaction effects in a
		  reconsideration of the democratic peace hypothesis. We
		  conclude with a more general consideration of the
		  circumstances in which GAMs are likely to be of use to
		  political scientists, as well as some apparent limitations
		  of the technique.},

	Abstract = {The recent proliferation of scholarship on collective
		  action frames and framing processes in relation to social
		  movements indicates that framing processes have come to be
		  regarded, alongside resource mobilization and political
		  opportunity processes, as a central dynamic in
		  understanding the character and course of social movements.
		  This review examines the analytic utility of the framing
		  literature for understanding social movement dynamics. We
		  first review how collective action frames have been
		  conceptualized, including their characteristic and variable
		  features. We then examine the literature related to framing
		  dynamics and processes. Next we review the literature
		  regarding various contextual factors that constrain and
		  facilitate framing processes. We conclude with an
		  elaboration of the consequences of framing processes for
		  other movement processes and outcomes. We seek throughout
		  to provide clarification of the linkages between framing
		  concepts/processes and other conceptual and theoretical
		  formulations relevant to social movements, such as schemas
		  and ideology.},

@article{benkler01062013,
	Abstract = {The article considers several working anarchies in the
		  networked environment, and whether they offer a model for
		  improving on the persistent imperfections of markets and
		  states. I explore whether these efforts of peer mutualism
		  in fact offer a sufficient range of capabilities to present
		  a meaningful degree of freedom to those who rely on the
		  capabilities it affords, and whether these practices in
		  fact remain sufficiently nonhierarchical to offer a
		  meaningful space of noncoercive interactions. The real
		  utopias I observe here are perfect on neither dimension.
		  Internally, hierarchy and power reappear, to some extent
		  and in some projects, although they are quite different
		  than the hierarchy of government or corporate organization.
		  Externally, there are some spectacular successes, some
		  failures to thrive, and many ambiguous successes. In all,
		  present experience supports neither triumphalism nor
		  defeatism in the utopian project. Peer models do work, and
		  they do provide a degree of freedom in the capabilities
		  they provide. But there is no inexorable path to greater
		  freedom through voluntary open collaboration. There is a
		  good deal of uncertainty and muddling through. The last
		  part of the article suggests a theory of freedom that
		  supports the significance of even these obviously imperfect
		  peer systems with incomplete coverage of necessary human
		  capabilities, and explains why expanding the domain of
		  mutualism improves freedom and well-being under conditions
		  of persistent market imperfection and an inevitably
		  fallible state. Peer mutualism doesn't have to be perfect;
		  it merely needs to offer a new dimension or sufficient
		  diversity in how it instantiates capabilities and transmits
		  power to offer us, who inhabit the systems that these peer
		  systems perturb, a degree of freedom.},

	Abstract = {This paper exploits the emotional connections and viewer
		  attentiveness of mainstream media to evaluate the economic
		  impact of financial education messages on debt management
		  delivered through a popular television soap opera in South
		  Africa. The study uses a symmetric encouragement design to
		  compare outcomes of individuals who were randomly assigned
		  to watch a soap opera with financial messages, ``Scandal!''
		  to those of individuals who were invited to watch a similar
		  soap opera without financial messages, ``Muvhango.'' Both
		  shows overlapped in evening primetime and had similar past
		  viewership profiles. The financial storyline spanned two
		  months and featured one of the leading characters of the
		  show borrowing excessively and irresponsibly through
		  hire-purchase, gambling, and ending up in financial
		  distress; and eventually seeking help to find her way out.
		  Two intermediate and one final follow-up surveys were
		  conducted as part of the study. The analysis finds
		  individuals assigned to watch Scandal had significantly
		  higher financial knowledge of the issues highlighted in the
		  soap opera storyline, in particular messages delivered by
		  the leading character. On behavior, Scandal viewers were
		  almost twice more likely to borrow from formal sources,
		  less likely to engage in gambling, and less prone to enter
		  hire purchase agreements. Messages promoting a national
		  debt mediation helpline delivered by an external character
		  did not sustain traction beyond immediate interest. Three
		  qualitative focus groups highlight the importance of
		  emotional connections with the leading character in
		  motivating behavior change.},

	Abstract = {Public opinion polls appear to be a more inclusive form of
		  representation than traditional forms of political
		  participation. However, under certain circumstances,
		  aggregate public opinion may be a poor reflection of
		  collective public sentiment. I argue that it may be dif-
		  ficult to gauge true aggregate public sentiment on certain
		  socially sensitive issues. My analysis of NES data from
		  1992 reveals that public opinion polls overstate support
		  for government efforts to integrate schools. Specifically,
		  selection bias models reveal that some individuals who
		  harbor anti-integrationist sentiments are likely to hide
		  their so- cially unacceptable opinions behind a "don't
		  know" response. As an independent confir- mation of the
		  selection bias correction technique, I find that the same
		  methods which pre- dict that opinion polls understate
		  opposition to school integration also predict the results
		  of the 1989 New York City mayoral election more accurately
		  than the marginals of pre- election tracking polls.},

	Abstract = {As market reform has spread throughout the globe, both
		  scholars and policy makers have become increasingly
		  interested in measuring public opinion towards economic
		  changes. However, recent research from American politics
		  suggests that special care must be paid to how surveys
		  treat non-respondents to these types of questions. We
		  extend this line of inquiry to a well-known case of
		  large-scale economic reform, Russia in the mid-1990s. Our
		  major finding is that Russians who fail to answer survey
		  questions tend to be consistently less "liberal" than their
		  counterparts who are able to answer such questions. This
		  finding has implications both for our understanding of
		  Russian public opinion in the 1990s, as well as for
		  measuring attitudes towards economic reform more generally.

		  success---may, in fact, be best understood as indicators of

		  racial cues prompts white voters to penalize black
		  candidates, and that the effects of these cues may
		  influence outcomes indirectly via perceptions of candidate
		  ideology. We test hypotheses related to these ideas using
		  two experiments based on national samples. In one
		  experiment, we manipulated the race of a candidate (Barack
		  Obama vs. John Edwards) accused of sexual impropriety. We
		  found that while both candidates suffered from the
		  accusation, the scandal led respondents to view Obama as
		  more liberal than Edwards, especially among resentful and
		  engaged whites. Second, overall evaluations of Obama
		  declined more sharply than for Edwards. In the other
		  experiment, we manipulated the explicitness of the scandal,
		  and found that implicit cues were more damaging for Obama
		  than explicit ones. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA,

		  in local government in South India? To answer this
		  question, we study two types of policy decisions that have

		  public goods. Our data on village councils in South India
		  show that, relative to other citizens, elected councillors
		  are more likely to be selected as beneficiaries of a large
		  transfer program. The chief councillor's village also
		  obtains more public goods, relative to other villages.
		  These findings can be interpreted using a simple model of

		  List experiments have attracted much attention recently as

		  examination of multivariate relationships between
		  respondents' characteristics and their responses to

		  for list experiments. We identify the commonly invoked
		  assumptions, propose new multivariate regression
		  estimators, and develop methods to detect and adjust for
		  potential violations of key assumptions. For empirical
		  illustration, we analyze list experiments concerning racial

		  List experiments have attracted much attention recently as
		  a potential solution to this measurement problem. Many
		  researchers, however, have used a simple
		  difference-in-means estimator, which prevents the efficient
		  examination of multivariate relationships between
		  respondents' characteristics and their responses to
		  sensitive items. Moreover, no systematic means exists to
		  investigate the role of underlying assumptions. We fill
		  these gaps by developing a set of new statistical methods
		  for list experiments. We identify the commonly invoked
		  assumptions, propose new multivariate regression
		  estimators, and develop methods to detect and adjust for
		  potential violations of key assumptions. For empirical
		  illustration, we analyze list experiments concerning racial
		  prejudice. Open-source software is made available to
		  implement the proposed methodology.},

	Abstract = {In randomized experiments, linear regression is often used
		  to adjust for imbalances in covariates between treatment
		  groups, yielding an estimate of the average treatment
		  effect with lower asymptotic variance than the unadjusted
		  estimator. If there are a large number of covariates, many
		  of which are irrelevant to the potential outcomes, the
		  Lasso can be used to both select relevant covariates and
		  perform the adjustment. We study the resulting estimator
		  under the Neyman-Rubin model for randomization. We present
		  conditions on the covariates and potential outcomes which
		  guarantee that the Lasso is more efficient than the
		  unadjusted estimator and provide a conservative estimate of
		  the asymptotic variance. Simulation and data examples show
		  that Lasso-based adjustment can be advantageous even when
		  $p<n$ and that a variant of Lasso, cv(Lasso+OLS), is
		  similar to cv(Lasso) in terms of confidence length and
		  coverage, but outperforms cv(Lasso) with much fewer
		  covariates in the adjustment.},

@article{boas2005,
	Abstract = {This concluding article returns to the broad question that
		  motivates this special issue of Studies in Comparative
		  International Development: Will the Digital Revolution
		  constitute a revolution in development? In addressing this
		  issue, we explore a number of common themes emphasized by
		  the different contributions: the future of the North-South
		  divide, the role of the state in promoting digital
		  development, the transferability and adaptability of
		  specific information and communication technologies, the
		  challenges and potential benefits of controlling digital
		  information, and the developmental effects of digitally
		  enabled communities. We argue that the Digital Revolution's
		  ultimate impact on development will depend on several key
		  variables, including the extent to which these technologies
		  foster within-country linkages among different sectors and
		  socioeconomic classes; the degree to which new
		  technological applications may be customized or transformed
		  to advance local development; and the outcome of political
		  contests between organized interests that are promoting
		  different ways of organizing and governing the global
		  digital economy. While it is difficult to fully assess a
		  transformation while living in the midst of it, research on
		  the social, political, and economic implications of the
		  Digital Revolution will constitute an important agenda for
		  development scholars in the years to come. [ABSTRACT FROM

	Abstract = {Since the publication of Robert Putnam's Making Democracy
		  Work , the concept of social capital has achieved a new
		  prominence in the social science community. This essay
		  explores the causal linkages among the key analytical
		  concepts presented in Robert Putnam's Making Democracy Work
		  in an effort to further the social capital research agenda
		  that the book initiates. We show why different kinds of
		  associations can be expected to have different social
		  capital-building capacities and different implications for
		  cooperation within the larger community. We suggest that
		  the microlinkages between social capital and good
		  government in Making Democracy Work are underspecified and
		  we present four models of how social cooperation at the
		  level of the community translates into good performance at
		  the level of political institutions. We identify the
		  absence of political conflict as a peculiar feature of
		  Putnam's account of Italian politics and history, and we
		  explore the implications of its absence for the theoretical
		  conclusions Putnam reaches and the generalizability of the
		  findings he presents. We examine the relationship between
		  social capital and economic performance and show why
		  Putnam's work has important contributions to make to this
		  field. Finally, we explain why Putnam's findings may not
		  travel well outside of the Italian regions he studies.},

		  in the structural equation. Second, in finite samples, IV
		  estimates are biased in the same direction as ordinary
		  least squares (OLS) estimates. The magnitude of the bias of
		  IV estimates approaches that of OLS estimates as the R(2)
		  between the instruments and the endogenous explanatory
		  variable approaches 0. To illustrate these problems, we
		  reexamine the results of a recent paper by Angrist and
		  Krueger, who used large samples from the U.S. Census to
		  estimate wage equations in which quarter of birth is used
		  as an instrument for educational attainment. We find
		  evidence that, despite huge sample sizes, their IV
		  estimates may suffer from finite-sample bias and may be
		  inconsistent as well. These findings suggest that valid
		  instruments may be more difficult to find than previously
		  imagined. They also indicate that the use of large data
		  sets does not necessarily insulate researchers from
		  quantitatively important finite-sample biases. We suggest
		  that the partial R(2) and the F statistic of the
		  identifying instruments in the first-stage estimation are
		  useful indicators of the quality of the IV estimates and
		  should be routinely reported.d},

		  commonly, a model for the dependence of outcomes Y on
		  confounders X and a potentially causal variable Z. When the
		  goal of the analysis is to infer Z's effects on Y , this

		  to decide how Z affects Y , the analyst first determines,
		  speculatively, the manner of Y 's dependence on Z and other

		  the conditional distribution of Y given X and Z, or perhaps
		  even denies that such a distribution exists. Our

@article{bowers2008,
	Abstract = {I do think, however, that if youre in the early phase of
		  your career as a graduate student in, say, Sociology, or
		  Economics, or Political Science, you should give some
		  thought to how youre going to organize and manage your
		  work. This is so for two reasons. First, the transition to
		  graduate school is a good time to make changes. Early on,
		  theres less inertia and cost associated with switching
		  things around than there will be later. Second, in the
		  social sciences, text and data management skills are
		  usually not taught to students explicitly. This means that
		  you may end up adopting the practices of your advisor or
		  mentor, continue to use what you are taught in your methods
		  classes, or just copy whatever your peers are doing.
		  Following these paths may lead you to an arrangement that
		  you will be happy with. But maybe not. Its worth looking at
		  the options.},

	Abstract = {Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are unlike traditional
		  individually randomized trials because observations within
		  the same cluster are positively correlated and the sample
		  size (number of clusters) is relatively small. Although
		  formulae for sample size and power estimates of CRT designs
		  do exist, these formulae rely upon first-order asymptotic
		  approximations for the distribution of the average
		  intervention effect and are inaccurate for CRTs that have a
		  small number of clusters. These formulae also assume that
		  the intracluster correlation (ICC) is the same for each
		  cluster in the CRT. However, for CRTs in which the clusters
		  are classrooms or medical practices, the degree of ICC is
		  often a factor of how many students are in each classroom
		  or how many patients are in each practice. Specifically,
		  smaller clusters are expected to have larger ICC than
		  larger clusters. A weighted sum of the cluster means, D, is
		  the statistic often used to estimate the average
		  intervention effect in a CRT. T},

		  hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are
		  ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative
		  interaction models have been found to capture their
		  intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political
		  science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the
		  execution of these models is often flawed and inferential
		  errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in
		  our understanding of the political world can occur if
		  scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for
		  using multiplicative interaction models presented in this
		  article. Only 10\% of the articles in our survey followed
		  the checklist.},

	Abstract = {Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are used in the
		  analysis of cluster randomized trials (CRTs) because: 1)
		  the resulting intervention effect estimate has the desired
		  marginal or population-averaged interpretation, and 2) most
		  statistical packages contain programs for GEE. However, GEE
		  tends to underestimate the standard error of the
		  intervention effect estimate in CRTs. In contrast,
		  penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimates the standard
		  error of the intervention effect in CRTs much better than
		  GEE but is used less frequently because: 1) it generates an
		  intervention effect estimate with a conditional, or
		  cluster-specific, interpretation, and 2) PQL is not a part
		  of most statistical packages. We propose taking the
		  variance estimator from PQL and re-expressing it as a
		  sandwich-type estimator that could be easily incorporated
		  into existing GEE packages, thereby making GEE useful for
		  the analysis of CRTs. Using numerical examples and data
		  from an actual CRT, we compare the performance of this
		  variance estimator to others proposed in the literature,
		  and we find that our variance estimator performs as well as
		  or better than its competitors.},

	Abstract = {Adopting a unifying theme based on maximum statistics,
		  Multiple Comparisons Using R describes the common
		  underlying theory of multiple comparison procedures through
		  numerous examples. It also presents a detailed description
		  of available software implementations in R. The R packages
		  and source code for the analyses are available at
		  http://CRAN.R-project.org After giving examples of
		  multiplicity problems, the book covers general concepts and
		  basic multiple comparisons procedures, including the
		  Bonferroni method and Simes' test. It then shows how to
		  perform parametric multiple comparisons in standard linear
		  models and general parametric models. It also introduces
		  the multcomp package in R, which offers a convenient
		  interface to perform multiple comparisons in a general
		  context. Following this theoretical framework, the book
		  explores applications involving the Dunnett test, Tukey's
		  all pairwise comparisons, and general multiple contrast
		  tests for standard regression models, mixed-effects models,
		  and parametric survival models. The last chapter reviews
		  other multiple comparison procedures, such as
		  resampling-based procedures, methods for group sequential
		  or adaptive designs, and the combination of multiple
		  comparison procedures with modeling techniques. Controlling
		  multiplicity in experiments ensures better decision making
		  and safeguards against false claims. A self-contained
		  introduction to multiple comparison procedures, this book
		  offers strategies for constructing the procedures and
		  illustrates the framework for multiple hypotheses testing
		  in general parametric models. It is suitable for readers
		  with R experience but limited knowledge of multiple
		  comparison procedures and vice versa. See Dr. Bretz discuss

		  presents three data analyses based on random process
		  models: (a) a trend analysis, based on fitting a monotonic
		  trend to river heights; (b) an analysis of point process
		  data, with ordinal-valued marks, for damage assessment
		  following an earthquake, and (c) an analysis of
		  spatial-temporal meteorological data to estimate the speed
		  of motion of a 500 mbar surface. There is discussion of

	Abstract = {{In a new introduction to the 10th-anniversary edition of
		  <I>Gender Trouble</I>--among the two or three most
		  influential books (and by far the most popular) in the
		  field of gender studies--Judith Butler explains the
		  complicated critical response to her groundbreaking
		  arguments and the ways her ideas have evolved as a result.
		  Nevertheless, she has resisted the urge to revise what has
		  become a feminist classic (as well as an elegant defense of
		  drag, given Butler's emphasis on the performative nature of
		  gender). The book was produced, according to Butler, "as
		  part of the cultural life of a collective struggle that has
		  had, and will continue to have, some success in increasing
		  the possibilities for a livable life for those who live, or
		  try to live, on the sexual margins." An attack on the
		  essentialism of French feminist theory and its basis in
		  structuralist anthropology, <I>Gender Trouble</I> expands
		  to address the cultural prejudices at play in genetic
		  studies of sex determination, as well as the uses of gender
		  parody, and also provides a critical genealogy of the
		  naturalization of sex. A primer in gender studies--and sexy
		  reading for college caf\'{e}s. <I>--Regina Marler</I> }
		  {Since its publication in 1990, <i>Gender Trouble</i> has
		  become one of the key works of contemporary feminist
		  theory, and an essential work for anyone interested in the
		  study of gender, queer theory, or the politics of sexuality
		  in culture. This is the text where Judith Butler began to
		  advance the ideas that would go on to take life as
		  "performativity theory," as well as some of the first
		  articulations of the possibility for subversive gender
		  practices, and she writes in her preface to the 10th
		  anniversary edition released in 1999 that one point of
		  <i>Gender Trouble</i> was "not to prescribe a new gendered
		  way of life [...] but to open up the field of possibility
		  for gender [...]" Widely taught, and widely debated,
		  <i>Gender Trouble</i> continues to offer a powerful
		  critique of heteronormativity and of the function of gender
		  in the modern world.} {In this highly-acclaimed subversive
		  book, Butler examines the `trouble' with unproblematized
		  appeals to sex/gender identities. A seminal text for gender

	Abstract = {According to the sorting model of education, the impact of
		  education on civic engagement is relative, rather than
		  absolute. Education correlates with greater engagement
		  because it is a marker of social status; the degree of
		  status conferred by your level of education is determined
		  by the average level of education within your environment.
		  This article tests the sorting model by paying strict heed
		  to its assumptions. The analysis confirms the model, but
		  considerably narrows its reach. Sorting applies only to one
		  particular type (electoral activity), only when the
		  educational environment accounts for variation across age
		  and place, and only when one models the interactive
		  relationship between education at the individual and
		  environmental levels. Furthermore, sorting applies more to
		  men than women. The same analytical framework demonstrates
		  that being in a more highly educated environment amplifies
		  the relationship between education and democratic
		  enlightenment (political knowledge and tolerance).},

	Abstract = {This paper elaborates statistical models for the analysis
		  of regulatory review deadlines or ``review time goals'' and
		  their influence upon regulatory decisions. We outline two
		  sets of statistical methods for estimating the models. In
		  the first set, dynamic duration models of time to decision
		  are elaborated, with particular focus on semi-parametric
		  methods from which the behavioral structure of a regulatory
		  review can be induced or ``backed out.'' In the second set,
		  we consider different estimators for observational analysis
		  of whether the deadlines in question influence the
		  ``quality'' of the reviews or the likelihood of error. In
		  particular, we consider how to use results from the ``first
		  stage'' (induced behavioral review structure) to test
		  whether deadlines influence the distribution of error. We
		  apply these methods to the imposition of review-time goals
		  by the Prescription Drug User-Fee Act (PDUFA) and its
		  amended successors upon new drug review by the U.S. Food
		  and Drug Administration (FDA). Using the first set of
		  methods, we find broad evidence that the deadlines have
		  induced a piling of approvals right before the deadline
		  elapses. Using the second set of methods, we find that
		  these ``pre-deadline'' approvals are subject to
		  substantially different post market experiences than drugs
		  approved either after the deadlines or ``very early'' in
		  the approval process.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores how the quality of information
		  available to voters in{\'a}uences the choices they make in
		  the polling booth and in turn a{\S}ects the strategies of
		  political parties competing for their support. To do so,
		  the paper builds a model of redistributive politics under
		  asymmetric information and then tests the resulting
		  propositions with data from recent elections in Sierra
		  Leone. Using the Lindbeck and Weibull (1987) model as a
		  foundation, I incorporate a new determinant of voting
		  choice{\'o} candidate quality{\'o} which is only
		  imperfectly observed by voters. I show that voters with
		  better information about candidates are more likely to
		  cross ethnic party lines to support a high quality
		  candidate. Furthermore, since information encourages voters
		  to consider characteristics like candidate charisma that
		  are di¢ cult for parties to observe, it makes party
		  forecasting of expected vote shares more uncertain. Such
		  electoral uncertainty in turn induces parties to spread
		  their resources more evenly across jurisdictions. Two
		  institutional attributes of the empirical setting{\'o}
		  ethnicity-based politics and decentralization{\'o} enable
		  direct tests of these informational propositions as well as
		  a novel identi{\"O}cation strategy for the classic swing
		  voter hypothesis. My results suggest that information could
		  break the low accountability equilibrium in which citizens
		  cast their votes blindly along partisan lines, creating
		  little incentive for political parties to invest in
		  candidate quality or provide resources to areas outside the
		  most tightly contested jurisdictions.},

	Abstract = {Despite their importance, there is limited evidence on how
		  institutions can be strengthened. Evaluating the effects of
		  specific reforms is complicated by the lack of exogenous
		  variation in institutions, the difficulty of measuring
		  institu- tional performance, and the temptation to ``cherry
		  pick'' estimates from among the large number of indicators
		  required to capture this multifaceted subject. We evaluate
		  one attempt to make local institutions more democratic and

		  learning-by-doing effects. We exploit the random assign-
		  ment of a governance program in Sierra Leone, develop
		  innovative real-world outcome measures, and use a
		  preanalysis plan (PAP) to bind our hands against data
		  mining. The intervention studied is a ``community-driven
		  development'' program, which has become a popular strategy
		  for foreign aid donors. We find positive short-run effects
		  on local public goods and economic outcomes, but no
		  evidence for sustained impacts on collective action,
		  decision making, or the involvement of marginalized groups,
		  suggesting that the intervention did not durably reshape

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the Regression Discontinuity
		  (RD) design, units are assigned a treatment based on
		  whether their value of an observed covariate is above or
		  below a fixed cutoff. Under the assumption that the
		  distribution of potential confounders changes continuously
		  around the cutoff, the discontinuous jump in the
		  probability of treatment assignment can be used to identify
		  the treatment effect. Although a recent strand of the RD
		  literature advocates interpreting this design as a local
		  randomized experiment, the standard approach to estimation
		  and inference is based solely on continuity assumptions
		  that do not justify this interpretation. In this article,
		  we provide precise conditions in a randomization inference
		  context under which this interpretation is directly
		  justified and develop exact finite-sample inference
		  procedures based on them. Our randomization inference
		  framework is motivated by the observation that only a few
		  observations might be available close enough to the
		  threshold where local randomization is plausible, and hence
		  standard large-sample procedures may be suspect. Our
		  proposed methodology is intended as a complement and a
		  robustness check to standard RD inference approaches. We
		  illustrate our framework with a study of two measures of
		  party-level advantage in U.S. Senate elections, where the
		  number of close races is small and our framework is well
		  suited for the empirical analysis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{chang2010,
	Abstract = {<i>Objectives</i>. We seek to investigate the determinants
		  of corruption$\backslash$nin authoritarian polities. We
		  hypothesize that corruption in
		  nondemocratic$\backslash$nsettings will be greater where
		  the ruling group is personalistic$\backslash$nrather than a
		  political party or a military clique and that it
		  will$\backslash$nbe greater where rulers expect to remain
		  in power longer. We construct$\backslash$na new
		  operationalization of the selectorate theory advanced by
		  Bueno$\backslash$nde Mesquita et al. <i>Methods</i>. We use
		  cross-sectional statistical$\backslash$nanalysis (OLS) to
		  examine a sample of 40-odd authoritarian
		  regimes$\backslash$nas of 2000. <i>Results</i>. Our results
		  indicate that personalistic$\backslash$nand
		  personalistic-hybrid regimes are more prone to corruption
		  than$\backslash$nsingle-party and military regimes and also
		  that rulers who expect$\backslash$nto remain in power for
		  longer are less corrupt. Corroborating
		  previous$\backslash$nstudies, we document that the
		  availability of natural resources and$\backslash$nhigher
		  levels of institutionalized autocracy are associated
		  with$\backslash$ngreater corruption and that wealthier
		  countries experience less corruption.$\backslash$nOur
		  results are consistent with previous studies, including
		  that$\backslash$nof Bueno de Mesquita et al., but because
		  of our reconstruction of$\backslash$nselectorate theory in
		  terms of real-world regime types, they are$\backslash$nmore
		  easily interpretable. Conclusions. Our study sheds light
		  on$\backslash$nwhy African countries are so notoriously
		  corrupt. The personalistic$\backslash$nauthoritarian
		  regimes that have arisen there in the
		  postcolonial$\backslash$nperiod appear especially prone to
		  corruption, whereas military and$\backslash$nsingle-party
		  dictatorships are less corrupt.},

	Abstract = {Conservation investments are increasingly being
		  implemented through payments for ecosystem services (PES)
		  for the protection and restoration of ecosystem services
		  around the world. Previous studies suggested that social
		  norms have substantial impacts on environmental behaviors
		  of humans, including enrollment of PES programs. However,
		  it is still not well understood how social norms are
		  affected by the design of PES programs and how the
		  evolution of social norms may affect the efficiency of
		  conservation investments. In this paper, we developed an
		  agent-based simulation model to demonstrate the evolution
		  and impacts of social norms on the enrollment of
		  agricultural land in a PES program. We applied the model to
		  land plots that have been enrolled in China's
		  Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) to examine reenrollment in an
		  alternative payment program when the current payments
		  ceased. The study was conducted in Wolong Nature Reserve
		  where several thousand plant and animal species, including
		  giant pandas, may benefit from the reenrollment. We found
		  that over 15\% more GTGP land can be reenrolled at the same
		  payment if social norms were leveraged by allowing more
		  than 10 rounds of interactions among landholders regarding
		  their reenrollment decisions. With only three rounds of
		  interactions, an additional 7.5\% GTGP land was reenrolled
		  at the same payment due to the effects of social norms. In
		  addition, the effects of social norms were largest at
		  intermediate payments and were smaller at much higher or
		  much smaller payments. Even in circumstances where frequent
		  interactions among landholders about their enrollment
		  decisions are not feasible, policy arrangements that divide
		  households into multiple waves for sequential enrollment
		  can enroll over 11\% more land at a given payment level.
		  The approach presented in this paper can be used to improve
		  the efficiency of existing PES programs and many other

		  and to find optimal cutpoints for the given factors. For
		  any available database, the measure can be used to
		  construct optimal strata for a clinical trial. The paper
		  also presents a practical approach for reducing the number

	Abstract = {This paper uses an n-person public goods experiment with
		  costly retaliation as a way to assess and capture the role
		  of ethnic identifiability in people?s propensity to
		  cooperate or retaliate against each other in ethnically
		  diverse post conflict societies. The experiment is
		  conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina and field sites are
		  selected according to the OSCE survey on educational
		  performance in Bosnian schools and include a range of
		  monoethnic, integrated as well as segregated schools
		  (two-schools under one roof). After conducting
		  game-theoretic analysis given the different parameters of
		  identifiability, social structure and institutions, we
		  derive equilibrium predictions compare them to our
		  experimental results. The experiments are conducted using a
		  double-blind approach and are accompanied by an extended
		  survey of participants, to record demographic information,
		  cultural attitudes, their understanding of the experiment,
		  and further substantive questions on identifiablity as well
		  as preferences for cooperation and retaliation. In
		  addition, we conduct multivariate regression analysis using
		  experimental follow-up surveys, to determine what
		  demographic, attitudinal and personal history
		  characteristics drive the subjects? identifiability,
		  cooperation and retaliation. Through various controls and
		  treatments, the experiment assesses how the structure of
		  society and institutions affects identifiability as well as
		  its role on cooperation or retaliation among members of
		  different ethnic groups. The methodology combines
		  experimental economics with emerging applications of
		  political science field experiments (such as the work of
		  Haburymana, Humphreys, Posner and Weinstein). Using a field
		  experiment to understand how ethnic identifiability relates
		  to incentives for conflict and cooperation, does not only
		  contribute to important theoretical questions across the
		  fields of political economy, behavioral and experimental
		  economics, and political science but also has direct policy
		  implications for how the developed world (the North) can
		  promote post-conflict confidence-building measures that
		  foster trust and encourage the construction of functioning
		  post-conflict states in the developing world (the South).

		  Recent polls suggest that the long slide in public
		  confidence in America's political institutions and
		  authorities has finally ended. Ronald Reagan, who came to
		  Washington to bury government rather than praise it,
		  ironically has presided over a restoration of trust in the
		  competence of national leadership. We begin this article by
		  charting the contours of the unanticipated improvement in
		  the public's image of government, assessing the magnitude
		  of the increase in confidence, identifying the social
		  groups whose outlook has changed and specifying the
		  institutions that have gained in popular esteem. Our main
		  purpose, however, is to provide an explanation for the
		  resurgence of trust in government that addresses persistent
		  controversies about the theoretical and empirical status of
		  this concept.},

	Abstract = {Post-Soviet African democratization has introduced
		  elections into contexts that often lack restraints upon the
		  behavior of candidates, resulting in the emergence of voter
		  intimidation, vote-buying, and ballot fraud. We propose a
		  model of electoral competition where, although some voters
		  oppose violence, it is effective in intimidating swing
		  voters. We show that in equilibrium a weak challenger will
		  use violence, which corresponds to a terrorism strategy.
		  Similarly, a nationally weak incumbent will use repression.
		  However, a stronger incumbent facing local competition will
		  prefer to use bribery or ballot fraud. We discuss the
		  applicability of the model to several African elections.},

	Abstract = {In the past statistical theory advanced entirely by
		  deductive reasoning, the theoretical route. However
		  inductive logic, the experimental method, is also feasible
		  now, with modern technology. Computer simulations help to
		  clarify the issues in cases where there are long-standing
		  conceptual problems; we have applied this technique to the
		  problem of the marginal totals in Fisher's exact test. It
		  becomes clear that both margins should be fixed. We
		  conclude that there are advantages if the strategy natural
		  to the mathematician, on the one hand, and the scientist,
		  on the other, are used concurrently.},

		  observations are accurate reflections of the true values of

		  incentives for respondents to misrepresent themselves to

		  limited to difference-in-means tests. I present a revised

		  and pluralism in diverse societies. It argues that religion
		  enters the public sphere by defining countervailing
		  narratives about sectarianism, which is exclusive and
		  divisive, and ecumenicism, which is inclusive and unifying.
		  Most empirical studies focus on elites as the producers of
		  discourse and ignore the regular people who comprise the
		  "real" public. In contrast to prior work, this article
		  systematically examines mass public discourse, with
		  Lebanon, a religiously diverse developing world society, as
		  its research venue. It uses a novel combination of original
		  survey data and publicly displayed religious and political
		  iconography to study the exchange of ideas about religion
		  and pluralism among the mass public. It shows that
		  sectarian discourse articulates ethnocentric and antiplural
		  statements, whereas ecumenicism, by contrast, mitigates
		  ethnocentrism and valorizes pluralism.},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT Are voting rights a class or an ethnic issue?
		  They are both$\backslash$nin the diverse societies of the
		  developing world, yet the salience$\backslash$nof ethnicity
		  in public discourse frequently compels people to
		  articulate$\backslash$nidentity demands that may be
		  inconsistent with their material
		  interests,$\backslash$nparticularly among the rich. This
		  article examines these ideas with$\backslash$nan augmented
		  list experiment about illiterate voting rights in
		  Lebanon.$\backslash$nConsistent with received wisdom,
		  direct questions yield identity-based$\backslash$nanswers
		  in which Shiites are more supportive of voting rights
		  than$\backslash$nare Sunnis or Christians. Unobtrusive
		  questions, in contrast, yield$\backslash$nanswers about
		  material deprivation in which poor people are
		  more$\backslash$nsupportive of illiterate voting than are
		  rich people. The divergence$\backslash$nbetween public
		  statements and private preferences helps to
		  reconcile$\backslash$ntheoretical predictions that people
		  respond to material incentives$\backslash$nwith empirical
		  findings that they pursue identity interests. },

@article{cox90trs,
	Abstract = {The formal theory of statistical analysis depends on the
		  abstractions that the data are observed values of random
		  variables, that a family of probability distributions (a
		  model) has, at least tentatively, been formulated and that
		  the objective of the analysis is connected in some way with
		  the underlying `true' distribution. These ideas, while very
		  powerful, are idealizations and in particular the choice of
		  the model is of critical importance. In addition, many
		  challenging aspects of applied statistics are, of course,
		  concerned with such issues as the meaning and quality of
		  data, and the interpretation of carefully chosen tables and
		  graphs, matters where the probabilistic aspect is barely
		  visible. It is argued that, while the recognition of this
		  is important, the moral is not that descriptive statistics
		  should be separated from probabilistic statistics, but
		  rather that the common ground should be explored; what is
		  the formal theory underlying descriptive methods and how
		  can the results of analyses based on elaborate theory be
		  presented in a striking and easily understood way? There
		  are various aspects to the choice of models. A first
		  distinction is between primary aspects, which in effect
		  serve to define the aspects of substantive interest, and
		  secondary aspects which complete the specification and
		  which thereby indicate appropriate efficient methods of
		  analysis and how to calculate measures of uncertainty.
		  Often, but not necessarily, the latter concern assumptions
		  of distributional shape and of independence; they are
		  secondary not in the sense of being unimportant but rather
		  in not being the primary focus of substantive interest.
		  Models, especially in their primary aspects, are of three
		  broad types, substantive (i.e. based on special
		  subject-matter knowledge or theory), empirical representing
		  usually smooth dependencies without any strong
		  subject-matter input and indirect models which are useful,
		  for example, for calibration of descriptive methods. All
		  three types can be subdivided in various ways; see Cox
		  (1990). These ideas were illustrated in some detail by
		  discussing various kinds of model for precipitation, for
		  example hourly rainfalls, and by the issues involved in
		  predicting the AIDS epidemic. The importance of interplay
		  between substantive and empirical ideas was emphasized.},

	Abstract = {We correct, update, and elaborate Curtin, Presser, and
		  Singer's (2000) report that the University of Michigan's
		  Survey of Consumer Attitudes (SCA) experienced only a small
		  response rate decline between 1979 and 1996, contrary to
		  the widespread perception of plunging response rates. Our
		  aims are to (1) correct errors in the SCA response rate
		  data that affected Curtin, Presser, and Singer's (2000)
		  result, (2) examine the trend in SCA response rates after
		  1996, when caller identification technology became
		  widespread, and (3) describe the roles played by the
		  various sources of SCA nonresponse over time. The results
		  show that the response rate decline from 1979 to 1996 was
		  larger than described by Curtin, Presser, and Singer
		  (2000); the response rate drop was significantly steeper
		  from 1996 to 2003 than from 1979 to 1996; and the 1979 to
		  2003 trends differed substantially for refusals and
		  noncontacts.},

@article{davis01062013,
	Abstract = {Shareholder-owned corporations were the central pillars of
		  the US economy in the twentieth century. Due to the success
		  of the shareholder value movement and the widespread
		  ``Nikefication'' of production, however, public
		  corporations have become less concentrated, less
		  integrated, less interconnected at the top, shorter-lived,
		  and less prevalent since the turn of the twenty-first
		  century, and there is reason to expect that their
		  significance will continue to dwindle. We are left with
		  both pathologies (heightened inequality, lower mobility,
		  and a fragmented social safety net) and new technologies
		  suitable for being repurposed in more democratic forms.
		  Local solutions for producing, distributing, and sharing
		  can provide functional alternatives to corporations for
		  both production and employment; what is needed is the
		  social organization to match the tools that we already
		  have, or will have shortly. The time for democratic local
		  economic forms prophesied by generations of activists may
		  finally be at hand.},

	Abstract = {We utilize a unique pair of experiments to isolate the
		  ways in which reductions in asymmetric information alter
		  credit market outcomes. A Guatemalan microfinance lender
		  gradually started using a credit bureau across its branches
		  without letting borrowers know about it. One year later, we
		  ran a large randomized credit information course that
		  described the existence and workings of the bureau to the
		  clients of this lender. This pairing of natural and
		  randomized experiments allows us to separately identify how
		  new information enters on the supply and the demand sides
		  of the market. Our results indicate that the credit bureau
		  generated large efficiency gains for the lender, and that
		  these gains were augmented when borrowers understood the
		  rules of the game. The credit bureau rewarded good
		  borrowers but penalized weaker ones, increasing economic
		  differentiation. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

@book{demesquita1997,
	Abstract = {In reviewing the history of portions of international
		  studies I reflect on how we might best advance knowledge. I
		  dwell on two issues: questions of method and the urgency of
		  refocusing our efforts on leaders and domestic affairs as
		  the centerpiece for understanding the world of
		  international relations. I argue that scientific progress
		  is best made by combining three methodological approaches
		  in our research: formal, mathematical logic to ensure
		  internal consistency in arguments about complex and
		  contingent relations among variables; case studies and
		  archival research to evaluate verisimilitude between theory
		  and action; and statistical analysis to establish the
		  generality of the hypothesized relations among variables.
		  Often such methodologically diverse and progressive
		  research will best be accomplished by encouraging
		  collaboration rather than by perpetuating the current norm
		  of penalizing coauthorship especially among junior
		  scholars. I offer concrete examples of advances in
		  knowledge achieved through the employment of mathematical
		  reasoning and statistical analysis as many have cast doubts
		  about the substantive contributions of these particular
		  approaches. My perspective is, of course, personal and may
		  not be shared by many others. I set out my thoughts,
		  therefore, with the hope that they will stimulate
		  constructive debate and dialogue and that they will serve
		  to integrate diverse approaches to international affairs.},

		  both of individuals' choices to speak or to listen and of
		  how they reinterpret their own views in the aftermath of
		  deliberation. We describe a game-theoretic laboratory
		  experiment in which subjects with diverse interests speak
		  or listen before voting over a common outcome. An important
		  feature of our strategic setting is that introspective
		  agents may, upon hearing an unpersuasive argument, update
		  away from the speaker's preferred position. While subjects
		  are responsive to strategic incentives, they also deviate
		  from Bayesian predictions by ``overspeaking'' when speech
		  is likelier to alienate than persuade. Subjects thus come
		  closer to the deliberative democratic ideal of a free
		  exchange of arguments than equilibrium predictions suggest.
		  We interpret evidence from subjects' deliberative choices
		  and policy votes in terms of a cognitive hierarchy among
		  subjects, defined by differing abilities to grasp the
		  strategic implications of different kinds of information.},

	Abstract = {The expected utility theory of decision making under
		  uncertainty, a cornerstone of modern economics, assumes
		  that humans linearly weight "utilities" for different
		  possible outcomes by the probabilities with which these
		  outcomes occur. Despite the theory's intuitive appeal, both
		  from normative and from evolutionary perspectives, many
		  experiments demonstrate systematic, though poorly
		  understood, patterns of deviation from EU predictions. This
		  paper offers a novel theoretical account of such patterns
		  of deviation by demonstrating that EU violations can emerge
		  from evolutionary selection when individual "status"
		  affects inclusive fitness. In humans, battles for resources
		  and social standing involve high-stakes decision making,
		  and assortative mating ensures that status matters for
		  fitness outcomes. The paper therefore proposes grounding
		  the study of decision making under uncertainty in an
		  evolutionary game-theoretic framework. ?? 2008 Elsevier

	Abstract = {Political actors inconflict settings are oftenuncertain
		  about their counterparts' intentions. This article explores
		  the psychology of how intentions are assessed using a novel
		  experimental design that randomly assigns subjects to one
		  of three roles--- ``proposer,'' ``recipient,'' or
		  ``observer.'' Recipients and observers are given identical
		  noisy information about proposers' actions, and make
		  postplay assessments of proposers' intentions that are
		  rewarded based on accuracy. A first experiment explores a
		  context of ambiguity,while a second experiment explores a
		  context of uncertainty. The results suggest that actors'
		  perceptions can sometimes be directly affected by the set
		  of strategic alternatives they possess. When signals about
		  proposer behavior appear ``negative,'' recipients'
		  assessments of proposers' intentions are more negative than
		  observers' assessments if recipients have the ability to
		  respond to the proposer's action---but not if recipients
		  lack this ability. The ability to respond to proposer
		  behavior appears to cause recipients to make more negative
		  inferences about the proposer than circumstances warrant.
		  Interestingly, recipients' and observers' assessments are
		  indistinguishable when signals about proposer behavior
		  instead appear ``positive.''},

		  the policy preferences of the people who are navigating
		  AIDS in their daily lives. Survey and ethnographic data on
		  the prioritization of HIV/AIDS interventions were collected
		  in a longitudinal cohort study in rural Malawi. Study
		  participants gave higher priority to problems other than
		  AIDS. Confining analysis to HIV-positive survey respondents
		  only weakly raises the prioritization of HIV/AIDS services.
		  The ethnographic data are consistent with these findings:
		  although rural Malawians are fully aware of the risk of
		  dying from AIDS, other problems are perceived as more
		  pressing for their community.},

	Abstract = {Four African leaders died in 2012. This article explores
		  the constellation of factors that together led to a
		  constitutional succession after President Bingu wa
		  Mutharika's death in Malawi, despite plotting by the late
		  President's allies to circumvent the constitution and
		  install their own candidate over Vice-President Joyce
		  Banda. We present data on execu- tive deaths in office
		  since 1961 and executive transfers of power 2010--12 in
		  order to situate the Malawi transition within the broader
		  African context, and draw especially on comparisons to
		  executive successions that followed the death-in-office of
		  presidents in Nigeria (2010) and Zambia (2008). We assert
		  from these cases that constitutional provisions on
		  executive succession are necessary in precipitating
		  peaceful transi- tions, but also argue that periods of
		  delay indicate that such provisions are insufficient on
		  their own. We contend that presidential death is more
		  likely to lead to transition than presidential incapacity.
		  The Malawian case in particular illustrates how a
		  constitutional transition requires support from key actors,
		  particularly the Cabinet, military leaders, judi- ciary,
		  civil society, and the independent media. Public rejection
		  of mili- tary or authoritarian rule, and the growing
		  precedent for constitutional succession in Africa, are
		  additional drivers of peaceful transitions.},

@article{diprete2004,
	Abstract = {Propensity score matching provides an estimate of the
		  effect of a ``treatment'' variable on an outcome variable
		  that is largely free of bias arising from an association
		  between treatment status and observable variables. However,
		  matching methods are not robust against ``hidden bias''
		  arising from unobserved variables that simultaneously
		  affect assignment to treatment and the outcome variable.
		  One strategy for addressing this problem is the Rosenbaum
		  bounds approach, which allows the analyst to determine
		  howstrongly an unmeasured confounding variable must affect
		  selection into treatment in order to undermine the
		  conclusions about causal effects from a matching analysis.
		  Instrumental variables (IV) estimation provides an
		  alternative strategy for the estimation of causal effects,
		  but themethod typically reduces the precision of the
		  estimate and has an additional source of uncertainty that
		  derives from the untestable nature of the assumptions of
		  the IV approach. A method of assessing this additional
		  uncertainty is proposed so that the total uncertainty of
		  the IVapproach can be compared with the Rosenbaumbounds
		  approach to uncertainty using matching methods. Because the
		  approaches rely on different information and different
		  assump- tions, they provide complementary information about
		  causal relationships. The approach is illustrated via an
		  analysis of the impact of unemployment insurance on the
		  timing of reemploy- ment, the postunemployment wage, and
		  the probability of relo- cation, using data from several
		  panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation
		  (SIPP).},

@article{druckman2008,
	Abstract = {One of the most noted phenomena in social and political
		  decision- making is the occurrence of a framing effect. For
		  example, on problems involving risky choices, individuals
		  tend to act risk-averse when the problem is framed in terms
		  of gains (e.g., saving lives, making money) and
		  risk-seeking when the same problem is instead framed in
		  terms of losses (e.g., deaths, losing money). Scholars have
		  begun to identify the processes underlying framing effects
		  as well as the conditions under which framing effects
		  occur. Yet, extant work focuses nearly exclusively on
		  cognitive processes, despite growing recognition of the
		  importance of emotion in general decision-making tasks. In
		  this paper, we explore the impact of emotional states on
		  risk attitudes and framing. We find that emotions
		  significantly influence both individuals' tendencies to
		  take risks and the impact of a frame on risky choices
		  (e.g., emotions amplify or depress a frame's impact). The
		  precise role of emotions depends on the problem domain
		  (e.g., a life-death or a financial deci- sion), and the
		  specific type of emotion under study. Moreover, in contrast
		  to much work in political science, we show that emotions
		  need to be distinguished beyond their positive or negative
		  valence, as different negative emotions exert opposite
		  effects. Our results accentuate the importance of
		  integrating emotions into research areas traditionally
		  dominated by more cognitive perspectives.},

		  sharp fall in coffee prices during the late 1990s increased

		  expanding local government budgets and raising potential
		  gains from rapacity and predation on these resources. Our

		  persistent problems in modern democracy and democratic
		  theory. Duff explains how influential theories of
		  democratic citizenship rely on the metaphor of parenthood
		  to help individuals rise to the challenges of politics, and
		  demonstrates that this reliance has unintended
		  consequences. When parenthood is imagined to instill
		  confidence in political virtue, it uncovers insecurity.
		  When parenthood is believed to inculcate openness to
		  change, it produces fundamentalism. Duff develops this
		  argument through original readings of four theorists of
		  citizenship: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche,
		  Richard Rorty, and Cornel West-readings that engage the
		  ways in which these theorists incorporated their personal
		  history into their political thought. In showing how
		  problems that plagued canonical theorists of citizenship
		  still trouble contemporary thinkers and citizens alike,
		  Duff's insights are deeply relevant to present-day
		  politics.},

	Abstract = {In many applications of instrumental-variables regression,
		  researchers seek to defend the plausibility of a key
		  assumption: the instrumental variable is independent of the
		  error term in a linear regression model. Although
		  fulfilling this exogeneity criterion is necessary for a
		  valid application of the instrumental-variables approach,
		  it is not sufficient. In the regression context, the
		  identification of causal effects depends not just on the
		  exogeneity of the in- strument but also on the validity of

		  feature of such models: the assumption that variation in
		  the endogenous regressor that is related to the
		  instrumental variable has the same effect as variation that
		  is unrelated to the instrument. In many applications, this
		  assumption may be quite strong, but relaxing it can limit
		  our ability to estimate parameters of interest. After
		  discussing two substantive exam- ples, I develop analytic
		  results (simulations are reported elsewhere). I also

	Abstract = {In many applications of instrumental-variables regression,
		  researchers seek to defend the plausibility of a key
		  assumption: the instrumental variable is independent of the
		  error term in a linear regression model. Although
		  fulfilling this exogeneity criterion is necessary for a
		  valid application of the instrumental-variables approach,
		  it is not sufficient. In the regression context, the
		  identification of causal effects depends not just on the
		  exogeneity of the in- strument but also on the validity of
		  the underlying model. In this article, I focus on one
		  feature of such models: the assumption that variation in
		  the endogenous regressor that is related to the
		  instrumental variable has the same effect as variation that
		  is unrelated to the instrument. In many applications, this
		  assumption may be quite strong, but relaxing it can limit
		  our ability to estimate parameters of interest. After
		  discussing two substantive exam- ples, I develop analytic
		  results (simulations are reported elsewhere). I also
		  present a spec- ification test that may be useful for
		  determining the relevance of these issues in a given
		  application},

		  the politics of race and social class. Yet ethno-linguistic
		  cleavages also played an important role in the transition
		  to democracy, and they arguably shape the character of
		  electoral competition today. To assess the relative weight
		  of racial, class, and linguistic ties in shaping political
		  preferences, I conducted an experiment with a probability
		  sample of residents of Johannesburg and Cape Town, in which
		  participants were shown similar videotaped political
		  speeches by actors of varying race, native language, and
		  stated class backgrounds. On average, I find strong race
		  effects, some evidence for language effects, and perhaps
		  counterintuitive class effects. Most interesting are the
		  results for distinct sub-groups. There is strong evidence
		  of a race effect for Whites and none for Blacks, while
		  language effects appear to be stronger for linguistic
		  groups that have arguably wielded less political power in
		  the post-apartheid period. Finally, poorer subjects tend to
		  favor richer candidates, an effect that is most pronounced

	Abstract = {"Coming home to eat" [Nabhan, 2002. Coming Home to Eat:
		  The Pleasures and Politics of Local Foods. Norton, New
		  York] has become a clarion call among alternative food
		  movement activists. Most food activist discourse makes a
		  strong connection between the localization of food systems
		  and the promotion of environmental sustainability and
		  social justice. Much of the US academic literature on food
		  systems echoes food activist rhetoric about alternative
		  food systems as built on alternative social norms. New ways
		  of thinking, the ethic of care, desire, realization, and
		  vision become the explanatory factors in the creation of
		  alternative food systems. In these norm-based explanations,
		  the "Local" becomes the context in which this type of
		  action works. In the European food system literature about
		  local "value chains" and alternative food networks,
		  localism becomes a way to maintain rural livelihoods. In
		  both the US and European literatures on localism, the
		  global becomes the universal logic of capitalism and the
		  local the point of resistance to this global logic, a place
		  where "embeddedness" can and does happen. Nevertheless, as
		  other literatures outside of food studies show, the local
		  is often a site of inequality and hegemonic domination.
		  However, rather than declaim the "radical particularism" of
		  localism, it is more productive to question an "unreflexive
		  localism" and to forge localist alliances that pay
		  attention to equality and social justice. The paper
		  explores what that kind of localist politics might look
		  like.},

		  People use all of the information available to them in
		  forming expectations about others' play, including
		  information about individual characteristics (such as sex
		  or race) as well as many forms of verbal and nonverbal
		  communications. The most obvious of these is the human
		  face. Two experiments are presented that examined facial
		  expression and perceived trustworthiness. Results show that
		  there can be a mismatch between attitudes and action. In
		  both studies, individuals were adept at assessing the
		  emotional content of the facial expression of an image, and
		  draw inferences about trustworthiness. (PsycINFO Database

		  two-person sequential, binary trust game, we examine the
		  relationship between risk attitudes and the decision to

		  behavioral risk measures and one survey measure of risk
		  attitudes in addition to the trust game. We find no

	Abstract = {We develop and evaluate a simple gamble-choice task to
		  measure attitudes toward risk, and apply this measure to
		  examine differences in risk attitudes of male and female
		  university students. In addition, we examine stereotyping
		  by asking whether a person's sex is read as a signal of
		  risk preference. Subjects choose which of five 50/50
		  gambles they wish to play. The gambles include one sure
		  thing; the remaining four increase (linearly) in expected
		  payoff and risk. Each subject also is asked to guess which
		  of the five gambles each of the other subjects chose, and
		  is paid for correct guesses. The experiment is conducted
		  under three different frames: an abstract frame where the
		  two highest-payoff gambles carry the possibility of losses,
		  an abstract frame with no losses, and an investment frame
		  that mirrors the payoff structure of the former. We find
		  that women are significantly more risk averse than men in
		  all three settings, and predictions of both women and men
		  tend to confirm this difference. While average guesses
		  reflect the average difference in choices, only 27 percent
		  of guesses are accurate, which is slightly higher than
		  chance. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

		  statistics. This talk examines his influence on modern
		  statistical thinking, trying to predict how Fisherian we
		  can expect the 21st century to be. Fisher's philosophy is
		  characterized as a series of shrewd compromises between the
		  Bayesian and frequentist viewpoints, augmented by some
		  unique characteristics that are particularly useful in
		  applied problems. Several current research topics are
		  examined with an eye toward Fisherian influence, or the
		  lack of it, and what this portends for future statistical
		  developments. Based on the 1996 Fisher lecture, the article
		  closely follows the text of that talk.},

	Abstract = {Modern scientific technology has provided a new class of
		  large-scale simultaneous inference problems, with thousands
		  of hypothesis tests to consider at the same time.
		  Microarrays epitomize this type of technology, but similar
		  situations arise in proteomics, spectroscopy, imaging, and
		  social science surveys. This paper uses false discovery
		  rate methods to carry out both size and power calculations
		  on large-scale problems. A simple empirical Bayes approach
		  allows the false discovery rate (fdr) analysis to proceed
		  with a minimum of frequentist or Bayesian modeling
		  assumptions. Closed-form accuracy formulas are derived for
		  estimated false discovery rates, and used to compare
		  different methodologies: local or tail-area fdr's,
		  theoretical, permutation, or empirical null hypothesis
		  estimates. Two microarray data sets as well as simulations
		  are used to evaluate the methodology, the power diagnostics
		  showing why nonnull cases might easily fail to appear on a
		  list of ``significant'' discoveries.

	Abstract = {From the reviews:<br> <br> ``Concise and useful summaries
		  of the salient facts and formulas relating to [various]
		  distributions.'' -Journal of the American Statistical
		  Association<br> <br> ``A worthwhile reference.'' -Journal
		  of Quality Technology<br> <br> Since the previous edition
		  of this popular guide to the most commonly used statistical
		  distributions was published in 1993, statistical methods
		  have found many new applications in science, medicine,
		  engineering, business/finance, and the social sciences. To
		  keep pace with these developments and to highlight the
		  growing influence of statistical software and data
		  management techniques, this new edition is now thoroughly
		  updated and revised. Through clear, concise, easy-to-follow
		  presentations, the authors discuss the key facts and
		  formulas for 40 major probability distributions, fine-tune
		  all existing material, and continue to offer ready access
		  to vital information gleaned from hard-to-find places
		  across the literature. Highly useful both as an
		  introduction to basic principles and as a quick reference
		  guide, Statistical Distributions, Third Edition:<br> *
		  Presents the 40 distributions in alphabetical order<br> *
		  Provides all key formulas for each distribution<br> * Adds
		  a new chapter on the Empirical Distribution Function<br> *
		  Expands the Weibull Distribution to cover the 3 and 5
		  parameter versions<br> * Incorporates diagrams and tables
		  illustrating the characteristics of each distribution<br> *
		  Discusses the types of application for which distributions
		  are used<br> * Features references to relevant software
		  packages},

		  the effects of disclos- ing information about corruption
		  practices on electoral accountability. In 2003, as part of
		  an anticorruption program,Brazil's federal government began
		  to selectmu- nicipalities at random to audit their
		  expenditures of federally transferred funds. The findings
		  of these audits were then made publicly available and
		  disseminated to media sources. Using a data set on
		  corruption constructed from the audit re- ports, we compare
		  the electoral outcomes of municipalities audited before
		  versus after the 2004 elections, with the same levels of
		  reported corruption.We show that the release of the audit
		  outcomes had a significant impact on incumbents' elec-
		  toral performance, and that these effects were more
		  pronounced in municipalities where local radio was present
		  to divulge the information. Our findings highlight the
		  value of having a more informed electorate and the role
		  played by local media in enhancing political selection.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines if money matters in education by
		  looking at whether missing resources due to corruption
		  affect student outcomes. We use data from the auditing of
		  Brazil's local governments to construct objective measures
		  of corruption involving educational block grants
		  transferred from the central government to municipalities.
		  Using variation in the incidence of corruption across
		  municipalities and controlling for student, school, and
		  municipal characteristics, we find a significant negative
		  association between corruption and the school performance
		  of primary school students. Students residing in
		  municipalities where corruption in education was detected
		  score 0.35 standard deviations less on standardized tests,
		  and have significantly higher dropout and failure rates.
		  Using a rich dataset of school infrastructure and teacher
		  and principal questionnaires, we also find that school
		  inputs such as computer labs, teaching supplies, and
		  teacher training are reduced in the presence of corruption.
		  Overall, our findings suggest that in environments where
		  basic schooling resources are lacking, money does matter
		  for student achievement. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {One of the greatest threats to the peaceful resolution of
		  civil wars comes from "spoilers," leaders and factions who
		  use violent or nonviolent strategies to alter the course
		  and outcome of a peace process. Spoilers have successfully
		  wrecked peace agreements in contexts as diverse as Rwanda,
		  Angola, Northern Ireland, and Bosnia. This dissertation
		  addresses the questions: (1) under what conditions do
		  individual groups use spoiling strategies that risk
		  derailing the peace process and (2) what are the aggregate
		  effects of spoiling behavior on the process as a whole. I
		  argue that to understand spoiler behavior, its causes and
		  effects over the course of an interdependent three-stage
		  peace process need to be examined. In particular, groups
		  must choose whether to spoil decisions to negotiate, peace
		  agreements, and the implementation of those agreements.
		  Changing incentives to spoil are rooted in the capability
		  and opportunity structure that groups face at each of these
		  stages. These incentives influence individual group
		  behavior (to spoil or cooperate), which; in turn, affects
		  the outcome of the peace process (is peace achieved, or is
		  there a return to war?). Because of the complexities of
		  civil wars (e.g., multiple factions, multiple stages, path
		  dependencies, and extreme uncertainty), I use an
		  agent-based computational model to generate hypotheses
		  about spoiling behavior. The hypotheses are tested using
		  data on all civil wars between 1945-1999, and with case
		  studies of the Bosnia and Rhodesia/Zimbabwe civil wars.
		  Empirical tests support many of the theoretical
		  propositions and show that spoiling behavior occurs
		  throughout peace processes often motivated by different
		  factors, and having different effects, depending on the
		  stage of the process.},

	Abstract = {Civil war dynamics and outcomes are shaped by processes of
		  change largely unaccounted for in current studies. This
		  examination explores how the fragmentation of combatants,
		  especially the weaker actors, affects the duration and
		  outcomes of civil wars. Some results of a computational
		  modelling analysis are consistent with the article's
		  expectations, several of them are counterintuitive. They
		  show that when combatants fragment, the duration of war
		  does not always increase and such wars often end in
		  negotiated agreements, contrasting with the expectations of
		  literatures on spoilers, moderates and extremists.
		  Empirical cases, such as Iraq, Congo, Chechnya and the
		  Sudan, illustrate the importance of fragmentation. This
		  study demonstrates the value of accounting for diverse
		  changes in actors and circumstances when studying the
		  dynamics of war. Since},

	Abstract = {{<P>"I have never read a book on regression that reflects
		  as broad and profound a grasp of the concepts of statistics
		  as this book does. In every topic John Fox deals with--and
		  he does not avoid the slippery ones--he shows a clarity and
		  depth of understanding that goes beyond anything else I
		  have seen in textbooks and that matches the works of the
		  leading researchers within each field."</P><P> --Georges
		  Monette, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York
		  University </P><P>"The selection of examples throughout the
		  book is one of its strengths, as they are generally quite
		  engaging in ''real-world'' interest, and demonstrate the
		  practical use (and limitations) of the statistical methods
		  far better than contrived data. I appreciate the fact that
		  John Fox describes what each example ''means'' in terms of
		  the substantive problem behind the data--students would
		  find this quite useful."</P><P> --Michael Friendly,
		  Psychology Department, York University </P><P>Aimed at
		  researchers and students who want to use linear models for
		  data analysis, John Fox's book provides an accessible,
		  in-depth treatment of regression analysis, linear models,
		  and closely related methods. Fox incorporates nearly 200
		  graphs and numerous examples and exercises that employ real
		  data from the social sciences. He begins the book with a
		  concise consideration of the role of statistical data
		  analysis in social research. He next covers graphical
		  methods for examining and transforming data, linear
		  least-squares regression, dummy-variables regression, and
		  analysis of variance. Fox also explores diagnostic methods
		  for discovering whether a linear model fit to data
		  adequately represents the data; extensions to linear least
		  squares, including logit and probit models, time-series
		  regression, nonlinear regression, robust regression, and
		  nonparametric regression; and empirical methods for
		  assessing sampling variation, including the bootstrap and
		  cross-validation. More difficult material is segregated in
		  separate sections and chapters and several appendixes are
		  also included presenting background information. Scholars,
		  professionals, researchers, and students in research
		  methods, evaluation, education, sociology, and psychology
		  will appreciate the enhanced and thorough treatment that
		  regression analysis, linear models, and other related
		  methods have received by author John Fox. </P>}},

@article{fran:1989,
	Abstract = {Theories demand much of data, often more than a single
		  data collection can provide. For example, many important
		  research questions are set in the past and must rely on
		  data collected at that time and for other purposes. As a
		  result, we often find that the data lack crucial variables.
		  Another common problem arises when we wish to estimate the
		  relationship between variables that are measured in
		  different data sets. A variation of this occurs with a
		  split half sample design in which one or more important
		  variables appear on the ``wrong'' half. Finally, we may
		  need panel data but have only cross sections available. In
		  each of these cases our ability to estimate the
		  theoretically determined equation is limited by the data
		  that are available. In many cases there is simply no
		  solution, and theory must await new opportunities for
		  testing. Under certain circumstances, however, we may still
		  be able to estimate relationships between variables even
		  though they are not measured on the same set of
		  observations. This technique, which I call two-stage
		  auxiliary instrumental variables (2SAIV), provides some new
		  leverage on such problems and offers the opportunity to
		  test hypotheses that were previously out of reach. This
		  article develops the 2SAIV estimator, proves its
		  consistency and derives its asymptotic variance. A set of
		  simulations illustrates the performance of the estimator in
		  finite samples and several applications are sketched out.

@article{fraser2004aci,
	Abstract = {Sufficiency has long been regarded as the primary
		  reduction procedure to simplify a statistical model, and
		  the assessment of the procedure involves an implicit global
		  repeated sampling principle. By contrast, conditional
		  procedures are almost as old and yet appear only
		  occasionally in the central statistical literature. Recent
		  likelihood theory examines the form of a general large
		  sample statistical model and finds that certain natural
		  conditional procedures provide, in wide generality, the
		  definitive reduction from the initial variable to a
		  variable of the same dimension as the parameter, a variable
		  that can be viewed as directly measuring the parameter. We
		  begin with a discussion of two intriguing examples from the
		  literature that compare conditional and global inference
		  methods, and come quite extraordinarily to opposite
		  assessments concerning the appropriateness and validity of
		  the two approaches. We then take two simple normal
		  examples, with and without known scaling, and progressively
		  replace the restrictive normal location assumption by more
		  general distributional assumptions. We find that
		  sufficiency typically becomes inapplicable and that
		  conditional procedures from large sample likelihood theory
		  produce the definitive reduction for the analysis. We then
		  examine the vector parameter case and find that the
		  elimination of nuisance parameters requires a
		  marginalization step, not the commonly proffered
		  conditional calculation that is based on exponential model
		  structure. Some general conditioning and modelling criteria
		  are then introduced. This is followed by a survey of common
		  ancillary examples, which are then assessed for conformity
		  to the criteria. In turn, this leads to a discussion of the
		  place for the global repeated sampling principle in
		  statistical inference. It is argued that the principle in
		  conjunction with various optimality criteria has been a
		  primary factor in the long-standing attachment to the
		  sufficiency approach and in the related neglect of the
		  conditioning procedures based directly on available
		  evidence.},

@article{free:1999,
	Abstract = {The {"}numerical method{"} in medicine goes back to Pierre
		  Louis' 1835 study of pneumonia and John Snow's 1855 book on
		  the epidemiology of cholera. Snow took advantage of natural
		  experiments and used convergent lines of evidence to
		  demonstrate that cholera is a waterborne infectious
		  disease. More recently, investigators in the social and
		  life sciences have used statistical models and significance
		  tests to deduce cause-and-effect relationships from
		  patterns of association; an early example is Yule's 1899
		  study on the causes of poverty. In my view, this modeling
		  enterprise has not been successful. Investigators tend to
		  neglect the difficulties in establishing causal relations,
		  and the mathematical complexities obscure rather than
		  clarify the assumptions on which the analysis is based.
		  Formal statistical inference is, by its nature,
		  conditional. If maintained hypotheses A, B, C,... hold,
		  then H can be tested against the data. However, if A, B,
		  C,... remain in doubt, so must inferences about H. Careful
		  scrutiny of maintained hypotheses should therefore be a
		  critical part of empirical work-a principle honored more
		  often in the breach than the observance. Snow's work on
		  cholera will be contrasted with modern studies that depend
		  on statistical models and tests of significance. The
		  examples may help to clarify the limits of current
		  statistical techniques for making causal inferences from
		  patterns of association.},

		  meetings based on programmatic, nonclientelist platforms.
		  The experiment involves the cooperation of leading
		  candidates in a presidential election in Benin. A campaign
		  strategy based solely on these meetings was assigned to
		  randomly selected villages and compared to the standard
		  strategy of clientelist rallies. We find that treatment
		  reduces the prevalence of clientelism and does not affect
		  turnout. Treatment also lowers the vote shares for the
		  candidate with a political stronghold in the village and is
		  more effective in garnering votes in regions where a
		  candidate does not have a political stronghold. (JEL D72,

	Abstract = {In Infotopia, citizens enjoy a wide range of information
		  about the organizations upon which they rely for the
		  satisfaction of their vital interests. The provision of
		  that information is governed by principles of democratic
		  transparency. Democratic transparency both extends and
		  critiques current enthusiasms about transparency. It urges
		  us to conceptualize information politically, as a resource
		  to turn the behavior of large organizations in socially
		  beneficial ways. Transparency efforts have targets, and we
		  should think of those targets as large organizations:
		  public and civic, but especially private and corporate.
		  Democratic transparency consists of four principles. First,
		  information about the operations and actions of large
		  organizations that affect citizens' interests should be
		  rich, deep, and readily available to the public. Second,
		  the amount of available information should be proportionate
		  to the extent to which those organizations jeopardize
		  citizens' interests. Third, information should be organized
		  and provided in ways that are accessible to individuals and
		  groups that use that information. Finally, the social,
		  political, and economic structures of society should be
		  organized in ways that allow individuals and groups to take
		  action based on Infotopia's public disclosures.},

	Abstract = {Direct-democratic processes have won popular support but
		  fall far short of the standards of deliberative democracy.
		  Initiative and referendum processes furnish citizens with
		  insufficient information about policy problems, inadequate
		  choices among policy solutions, flawed criteria for
		  choosing among such solutions, and few opportunities for
		  reflection on those choices prior to decision making. We
		  suggest a way to make direct democracy more deliberative by
		  grafting randomly selected citizen assemblies onto existing
		  institutions and practices. After reviewing the problems
		  that beset modern direct-democratic elections and the long
		  history of randomly selected citizen assemblies, we propose
		  five different varieties of randomly constituted citizen
		  bodies---Priority Conferences, Design Panels, Citizens'
		  Assemblies, Citizens' Initiative Reviews, and Policy
		  Juries. After selecting members through stratified random
		  sampling of citizens, each of these assemblies would
		  operate at a different stage of the legislative process,
		  from initial problem identification through approval of a
		  finished ballot measure. Highly structured procedures
		  guided by professional moderators and featuring expert
		  testimony on policy and legal matters would help to ensure
		  deliberative quality, and careful institutional designs
		  would make each body politically powerful. In the end,
		  these citizen bodies would be likely to address the
		  deliberative deficit of direct democracy and better achieve
		  the public's desired policy objectives.},

	Abstract = {Contrary to the conventional understanding that reform is
		  more difficult when veto players are numerous, we show
		  formally that veto players may encourage policy change by
		  weakening the power of special interests that prefer
		  inefficient reform outcomes. Using the same model, we
		  demonstrate that reform reversals are less likely in the
		  presence of multiple veto players, implying that a
		  constitutional framework conducive to initial reforms may
		  also lock in those achievements over time. We find support
		  for our theoretical perspective in a study of the
		  relationship between veto players and economic reform in
		  Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.},

		  many classic studies in political science and psychology
		  contend that people resist discordant information, more

		  biased assimilation and belief polarization using a formal
		  model that encompasses both Bayesian and biased learning.
		  The analysis reveals (a) the conditions under which these
		  phenomena may be consistent with Bayesian learning, (b) the
		  methodological inadequacy of certain research designs that
		  fail to control for preferences or prior information, and
		  (c) the limited support that exists for the more extreme

		  the statistical significance of re- search findings, the
		  published literature may suffer from ``publication bias.''
		  This paper describes a method for detecting publication
		  bias. We point out that to achieve statisti- cal
		  significance, the effect size must be larger in small
		  samples. If publications tend to be biased against
		  statistically insignificant results, we should observe that
		  the effect size diminishes as sample sizes increase. This
		  proposition is tested and confirmed using the experimental

	Abstract = {Habit is a frequently mentioned but understudied cause of
		  political action. This article provides the first direct
		  test of the hypothesis that casting a ballot in one
		  election increases ones propensity to go to the polls in
		  the future. A field experiment involving 25,200 registered
		  voters was conducted prior to the November general election
		  of 1998. Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment
		  conditions in which they were urged to vote through direct
		  mail or face-to-face canvassing. Compared to a control
		  group that received no contact, the treatment groups were
		  significantly more likely to vote in 1998. The treatment
		  groups were also significantly more likely to vote in local
		  elections held in November of 1999. After deriving a
		  statistical estimator to isolate the effect of habit, we
		  find that, ceteris paribus, voting in one election
		  substantially increases the likelihood of voting in the
		  future. Indeed, the influence of past voting exceeds the
		  effects of age and education reported in previous
		  studies.},

	Abstract = {This article reports the results of several field
		  experiments designed to measure campaign effects in
		  partisan contests. The findings suggest incumbent campaigns
		  failed to increase incumbent vote share, whereas the
		  challenger campaign was effective. To understand these and
		  other results, the incumbent's optimal spending strategy
		  was analyzed theoretically. The analysis reveals that if
		  incumbents maximize their probability of victory rather
		  than vote share, campaigns by typical incumbents are
		  expected to produce only minimal improvement in incumbent
		  vote share. The analysis also explains how returns to
		  campaign spending vary with the competitiveness of the
		  election, how incumbent spending can improve the
		  incumbent's probability of victory yet have only minimal
		  effect on incumbent vote share, and why rational spending
		  plans might decrease the sponsor's expected vote. This
		  article demonstrates the wide scope of application for
		  field experiments and provides an example of how

		  example is that compressions between expiermental and

		  compliance - in treatment they can give you the local atrea

		  exposure to newspapers on political behavior and opinion.
		  Before the 2005 Virginia gubernatorial election, we
		  randomly assigned individuals to a Washington Post free
		  subscription treatment, a Washington Times free
		  subscription treatment, or a control treatment. We find no
		  effect of either paper on political knowledge, stated
		  opinions, or turnout in post-election survey and voter
		  data. However, receiving either paper led to more support
		  for the Democratic candidate, suggesting that media slant
		  mattered less in this case than media exposure. Some evi-
		  dence from voting records also suggests that receiving
		  either paper led to increased 2006 voter turnout.},

	Abstract = {Prior experimental research has demonstrated that voter
		  turnout rises substantially when people receive mailings
		  that indicate whether they voted in previous elections.
		  This effect suggests that voters are sensitive to whether
		  their compliance with the norm of voting is being
		  monitored. The present study extends this line of research
		  by investigating whether disclosure of past participation
		  has a stronger effect on turnout when it calls attention to
		  a past abstention or a past vote. A sample of 369,211
		  registered voters who voted in just one of two recent
		  elections were randomly assigned to receive no mail, mail
		  that encouraged them to vote, and mail that both encouraged
		  them to vote and indicated their turnout in one previous
		  election. The latter type of mailing randomly reported
		  either the election in which they voted or the one in which
		  they abstained. Results suggest that mailings dis- closing
		  past voting behavior had strong effects on voter turnout
		  and that these effects were significantly enhanced when it
		  disclosed an abstention in a recent election.},

@article{gerber2010a,
	Abstract = {Previous research shows that partisans rate the economy
		  more favorably when their party holds power. There are
		  several explanations for this association, including use of
		  different evaluative criteria, selective perception,
		  selective exposure to information, correlations between
		  economic experiences and partisanship, and partisan bias in
		  survey responses. We use a panel survey around the November
		  2006 election to measure changes in economic expectations
		  and behavioral intentions after an unanticipated shift in
		  political power. Using this design, we can observe whether
		  the association between partisanship and economic
		  assessments holds when some leading mechanisms thought to
		  bring it about are excluded. We find that there are large
		  and statistically significant partisan differences in how
		  economic assessments and behavioral intentions are revised
		  immediately following the Democratic takeover of Congress.
		  We conclude that this pattern of partisan response suggests
		  partisan differences in perceptions of the economic
		  competence of the parties, rather than alternative
		  mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Methods are usually classified as either "experimental" or
		  "observational," a dichotomy has governed that social
		  science research for centuries. By implication, this
		  dichotomization precludes a consideration of experimental
		  strategies in case study work. Yet, we argue that one gains
		  purchase on the tasks of research design by integrating the
		  criteria traditionally applied to experimental to all
		  research work in the social sciences-including case study
		  work, focus the of this article. Experimental research
		  designs aim to achieve variation through time and across
		  space while maintaining ceteris paribus assumptions, thus
		  maximizing leverage the into fundamental problem of causal
		  inference. propose We to capture these multiple criteria in
		  a four-fold typology: (1) A Dynamic comparison mirrors
		  laboratory experimentation through the use of both temporal
		  and spatial variation; (2) A Longitudinal comparison
		  employs temporal variation; (3) A Spatial comparison
		  exploits variation through space; and (4) A Counterfactual
		  comparison relies on imagined comparison. All comparison
		  case study research designs can be slotted into one of
		  these four categories. Moreover, the typology illustrates
		  in a concise fashion the ways in which case study research
		  designs attempt to mimic virtues the of experimental design
		  and the degree to which they succeed. The classic
		  experiment, manipulated with treatment and randomized
		  control, provides thus a useful template discussion for
		  about methodological in experimental issues and
		  observational contexts.},

		  reveals that different institutions shaped members'

		  <i>A Postcapitalist Politics</i> reveals a prolific

		  economy, feminist poststructuralism, and economic activism
		  to foreground the ethical decisions, as opposed to
		  structural imperatives, that construct economic
		  ``development'' pathways. Marshalling empirical evidence
		  from local economic projects and action research in the
		  United States, Australia, and Asia, they produce a
		  distinctive political imaginary with three intersecting
		  moments: a politics of language, of the subject, and of
		  collective action. In the face of an almost universal sense
		  of surrender to capitalist globalization, this book
		  demonstrates that postcapitalist subjects, economies, and
		  communities can be fostered. The authors describe a

	Abstract = {Using the Rosenbaum (2002, 2009) approach to observational
		  studies, we show how qualita- tive information can be
		  incorporated into quantitative analyses to improve causal
		  inference in three ways. First, we can ameliorate the e
		  ects of dicult-to-measure outcomes by including qualitative
		  information on outcomes within matched sets, sometimes
		  reducing p -values. Second, additional information across
		  matched sets enables the construction of qualitative con
		  dence in- tervals on e ect size. Third, qualitative
		  information on unmeasured confounders within matched sets
		  reduces the conservativeness of Rosenbaum-style sensitivity
		  analysis. This approach accom- modates small to medium
		  sample sizes in a nonparametric framework, and therefore
		  may be particularly useful for analyses of the e ects of
		  institutions in a given set of units. We illus- trate these
		  methods by examining the e ect of using plurality rules in
		  transitional presidential elections on opposition
		  harassment in 1990s sub-Saharan Africa.},

		  institutional conditions permitting, unions' coordination
		  of bargaining strategies is sufficient. Coordination is
		  most likely to be achieved when there are small number of
		  unions that do not compete for members, that is, when union
		  monopoly is high. Important empirical anomalies may be
		  resolved by analyzing the effects of union centralization
		  and monopoly separately, rather than combining them into a
		  composite index of corporatism. Reanalyzing comparative
		  data from Organization of Economic Cooperation and
		  Development countries between 1963 and 1985 largely
		  corroborates the hypothesis that monopoly is more important
		  than either centralization or composite indices of
		  corporatism for national economic performance. The

		  We find that these are quite different in the 1980s than in

		  in the 1990s, it has been because of government policy, in

	Abstract = {This article analyzes the political determinants of the
		  distribution of infrastructure expenditures by the Italian
		  government to the country's 92 provinces between 1953 and
		  1994. Extending implications of theories of legislative
		  behavior to the context of open-list proportional
		  representation, we examine whether individually powerful
		  legislators and ruling parties direct spending to core or
		  marginal electoral districts and whether opposition parties
		  share resources via a norm of universalism. We show that
		  when districts elect politically more powerful deputies
		  from the governing parties, they receive more investments.
		  We interpret this as indicating that legislators with
		  political resources reward their core voters by investing
		  in public works in their districts. The governing parties,
		  by contrast, are not able to discipline their own members
		  of parliament sufficiently to target the parties' areas of
		  core electoral strength. Finally, we find no evidence that
		  a norm of universalism operates to steer resources to areas
		  when the main opposition party gains more votes.},

		  democracy's role in development by identifying avenues of
		  democratic failure in a developing country context. I argue
		  that particular featrues of developing countries make
		  voters less likely to control politicians and political
		  parties more likely to collude with one another. Using a
		  unique local-level dataset from one developing democracy,
		  Mali, I test these sources of democratic failure and the
		  conditions that make them more or less likely. I explore
		  variation in local public goods provision across localities
		  as a proxy for understanding the determinants of government
		  performance. I nd that voters are better able to control
		  politicians when parties are more numer- ous and fragmented
		  and when information asymmetries are reduced, but that the
		  eects of party competition are conditional on information.
		  I also nd that collusion is less likely in the prescence of
		  relatively strong opposition parties that provide a
		  credible threat. Matching and regression discontinuity are
		  some of the identication strategies used to reach these
		  conclusions.},

	Abstract = {<p>In this article we examine the effects of measurement
		  error on the apparent stability of party identification. As
		  others have noted, party identification appears to be
		  highly stable once measurement error is taken into account.
		  This seems to be in conflict with recent models that claim
		  to demonstrate the responsiveness of partisanship to
		  short-term political forces. Using data from the 1980
		  National Election Study Major Panel, we demonstrate that
		  when measurement error is included explicitly in models of
		  political behavior, the effects of performance evaluations,
		  candidate evaluations, issue proximities, or vote choices
		  on party identification are negligible. Thus, it appears
		  that the findings that show a significant impact of these
		  short-term forces on partisanship represent artifacts of
		  inadequate measurement model specification. Our results
		  suggest that the outstanding characteristic of party
		  identification is its persistence over time},

@article{green1994,
	Abstract = {This essay refines and extends our argument (Green and
		  Palmquist, 1990) that net of the distorting effects of
		  measurement error, Americans' partisanship tends to be
		  highly stable over time. Three challenges to this thesis
		  are addressed. In response to doubts about the
		  generalizability of our earlier findings to panel studies
		  of longer duration or from other eras, we show that nine
		  multi-wave panel studies yield similar results. Next, we
		  take up the question of whether our model can account for
		  observed patterns of partisan conversion. The rate of
		  party-switching forces some modifications in the
		  statistical assumptions used to model party identification
		  over time, but a revised model which can account for
		  inter-party change reproduces earlier findings of partisan
		  stability. Third, we grapple with the question of how our
		  findings square with fluctuations in what has been termed
		  ``macropartisanship''. We suggest that aggregate shifts in
		  party identification need not be incompatible with strong
		  over-time correlations at the individual level. Finally, we
		  develop a simulation of micropartisanship to illustrate
		  that over long stretches of time very gradual changes in
		  partisanship can accumulate to produce appreciable levels
		  of micropartisan change.},

		  least squares (OLS) as applied to both individual-level and
		  cluster-level data. We also compare OLS to alternative
		  random effects estimators, such as generalized least
		  squares (GLS). Our simulations assess efficiency across a
		  variety of scenarios involving varying sample sizes and
		  numbers of clusters. Our results confirm that conventional
		  OLS SEs are severely biased downward and that, for all
		  estimators, gains in efficiency come mainly from increasing
		  the number of clusters, not increasing the number of
		  individuals within clusters. We find relatively minor
		  differences across alternative estimation approaches, but
		  GLS seems to enjoy a slight edge in terms of the efficiency
		  of its point estimates and the accuracy of its SEs. We
		  illustrate the application of alternative estimation
		  approaches using a clustered experiment in which Rock the
		  Vote TV advertisements were used to encourage young voters
		  in 85 cable TV markets to vote in the 2004 presidential

	Abstract = {Although blocking or pairing before randomization is a
		  basic principle of experimental design, the principle is
		  almost invariably applied to at most one or two blocking
		  variables. Here, we discuss the use of optimal multivariate
		  matching prior to randomization to improve covariate
		  balance for many variables at the same time, presenting an
		  algorithm and a case-study of its performance. The method
		  is useful when all subjects, or large groups of subjects,
		  are randomized at the same time. Optimal matching divides a
		  single group of 2n subjects into n pairs to minimize
		  covariate differences within pairs-the so-called
		  nonbipartite matching problem-then one subject in each pair
		  is picked at random for treatment, the other being assigned
		  to control. Using the baseline covariate data for 132
		  patients from an actual, unmatched, randomized experiment,
		  we construct 66 pairs matching for 14 covariates. We then
		  create 10000 unmatched and 10000 matched randomized
		  experiments by repeatedly randomizing the 132 patients, and
		  compare the covariate balance with and without matching. By
		  every measure, every one of the 14 covariates was
		  substantially better balanced when randomization was
		  performed within matched pairs. Even after covariance
		  adjustment for chance imbalances in the 14 covariates,
		  matched randomizations provided more accurate estimates
		  than unmatched randomizations, the increase in accuracy
		  being equivalent to, on average, a 7\% increase in sample
		  size. In randomization tests of no treatment effect,
		  matched randomizations using the signed rank test had
		  substantially higher power than unmatched randomizations
		  using the rank sum test, even when only 2 of 14 covariates
		  were relevant to a simulated response. Unmatched
		  randomizations experienced rare disasters which were
		  consistently avoided by matched randomizations.},

	Abstract = {We offer a framework for analyzing the impact of
		  monitoring---a commonly recommended solution to poor
		  leadership---on the quality of democratically elected
		  leaders in community organizations in low-income countries.
		  In our model, groups may face a trade-off between leader
		  ability and effort. If the group's ability to monitor the
		  leader is low, then the leader may exert too little effort.
		  A higher level of monitoring increases leader effort,
		  raising the value of the public good. However, more intense
		  monitoring may also drive higher-ability members to opt out
		  of candidacy, reducing public-goods value. The result is an
		  inverted U-shaped relationship between the level of
		  monitoring and the value of the public good. The trade-off
		  between leader effort and ability, however, only exists in
		  the presence of sufficient private-income opportunities.
		  These predictions are assessed using original data gathered

		  argue further that although the proliferation of

		  far-reaching decentralization reforms, it likely results in
		  a recentralization of power; the proliferation of new local
		  governments fragments existing units into smaller ones with

@article{gu2013,
	Abstract = {A comparison and evaluation is made of recent proposals
		  for multivariate matched sampling in observational studies,
		  where the following three questions are answered: (1)
		  Algorithms: In current statistical practice, matched
		  samples are formed using "nearest available" matching, a
		  greedy algorithm. Greedy matching does not minimize the
		  total distance within matched pairs, though good algorithms
		  exist for optimal matching that do minimize the total
		  distance. How much better is optimal matching than greedy
		  matching? We find that optimal matching is sometimes
		  noticeably better than greedy matching in the sense of
		  producing closely matched pairs, sometimes only marginally
		  better, but it is no better than greedy matching in the
		  sense of producing balanced matched samples. (2)
		  Structures: In common practice, treated units are matched
		  to one control, called pair matching or 1-1 matching, or
		  treated units are matched to two controls, called 1-2
		  matching, and so on. It is known, however, that the optimal
		  structure is a full matching in which a treated unit may
		  have one or more controls or a control may have one or more
		  treated units. Optimal 1 - k matching is compared to
		  optimal full matching, finding that optimal full matching
		  is often much better. (3) Distances: Matching involves
		  defining a distance between covariate vectors, and several
		  such distances exist. Three recent proposals are compared.
		  Practical advice is summarized in a final section.},

	Abstract = {Among the concerns faced by countries pondering the costs
		  and benefits of greater economic openness to international
		  capital flows is the worry that new and powerful external
		  actors will exert a corrupting influence on the domestic
		  economy. In this paper, we use a novel empirical strategy,
		  drawn from research in experimental psychology, to test the
		  linkage between foreign direct investment (FDI) and
		  corruption. The prevailing literature has produced confused
		  and contradictory results on this vital relationship due to
		  errors in their measurement of corruption which are
		  correlated with FDI inflows. When a less biased
		  operationalization is employed, we find clear evidence of
		  corruption during both registration and procurement
		  procedures in Vietnam. The prevalence of corruption,
		  however, is not associated with inflows of FDI. On the
		  contrary, one measure of economic openness appears to be
		  the most important driver of reductions in Vietnamese
		  corruption: the wave of domestic legislation, which
		  accompanied the country's bilateral trade liberalization
		  agreement with the United States (US-BTA), significantly
		  reduced bribery during business registration. ?? 2011

@article{habyarimana2007,
	Abstract = {A large and growing literature links high levelsof ethnic
		  diversity to lowlevelsof public goods provision. Yet
		  although the empirical connection between ethnic
		  heterogeneity and the underprovision of public goods is
		  widely accepted, there is little consensus on the specific
		  mechanisms through which this relationship operates. We
		  identify three families of mechanisms that link diversity
		  to public goods provision -- what we term ``preferences,''
		  ``technology,'' and ``strategy selection'' mechanisms --
		  and run a series of experimental games that permit us to
		  compare the explanatory power of distinct mecha- nisms
		  within each of these three families. Results from games
		  conducted with a random sample of 300 subjects from a slum
		  neighborhood of Kampala, Uganda, suggest that successful
		  public goods provision in homogenous ethnic communities can
		  be attributed to a strategy selectionmechanism: in similar
		  settings, co-ethnics play cooperative equilibria, whereas
		  non-co-ethnics do not. In addition, we find evidence for a
		  technology mechanism: co-ethnics aremore closely linked on
		  social networks and thus plausibly better able to support
		  cooperation through the threat of social sanction. We find
		  no evidence for prominent preference mechanisms that
		  emphasize the commonality of tastes within ethnic groups or
		  a greater degree of altruism toward co-ethnics, and only
		  weak evidence for technology mechanisms that focus on the
		  impact of shared ethnicity on the productivity of teams.},

		  representative survey data from 2004 through 2008 to
		  determine how the general public uses---or does not
		  use---the Internet in their political lives. The authors
		  then consider whether the patterns of use for this
		  technology appear different in the November 2008 general
		  election cycle. They consider this issue in the context of
		  increasing polarization among some fraction of the American
		  electorate and in the policy platforms of elected
		  officials.},

	Abstract = {In randomized experiments, treatment and control groups
		  should be roughly the same-balanced-in their distributions
		  of pretreatment variables. But how nearly so? Can
		  descriptive comparisons meaningfully be paired with
		  significance tests? If so, should there be several such
		  tests, one for each pretreatment variable, or should there
		  be a single, omnibus test? Could such a test be engineered
		  to give easily computed p-values that are reliable in
		  samples of moderate size, or would simulation be needed for
		  reliable calibration? What new concerns are introduced by
		  random assignment of clusters? Which tests of balance would
		  be optimal? To address these questions, Fisher's
		  randomization inference is applied to the question of
		  balance. Its application suggests the reversal of published
		  conclusions about two studies, one clinical and the other a
		  field experiment in political participation.},

	Abstract = {Statistical analysis requires a probability model:
		  commonly, a model for the dependence of outcomes Y on
		  confounders X and a potentially causal variable Z. When the
		  goal of the analysis is to infer Z's effects on Y , this
		  requirement introduces an element of circularity: in order
		  to decide how Z affects Y , the analyst first determines,
		  speculatively, the manner of Y 's dependence on Z and other
		  variables. This paper takes a statistical perspective that
		  avoids such circles, permitting analysis of Z's effects on
		  Y even as the statistician remains entirely agnostic about
		  the conditional distribution of Y given X and Z, or perhaps
		  even denies that such a distribution exists. Our
		  assumptions instead pertain to the conditional distribution
		  Z|X, and the role of speculation in settling them is
		  reduced by the use of such techniques as propensity scores,
		  poststratification, testing for overt bias before accepting
		  a poststratification, and optimal full matching. Such
		  beginnings pave the way for ``randomization inference'', an
		  approach which, despite a long history in the analysis of
		  designed experiments, is relatively new to political
		  science and to other fields in which experimental data are

		  and observational studies. We illustrate this by applying
		  it to analyze A. Gerber and D. Green's New Haven Vote 98
		  campaign. Conceived as both a get-out-the-vote campaign and
		  a field experiment in political participation, the campaign
		  as it turned out was in some ways more similar to an
		  observational study than to a randomized experiment. Our
		  analysis uses the strengths of the design of their study

		  inferences about these attributable effects and the
		  stratification and matching that precede them rely on quite

		  children in a classroom, or to all patients at a clinic, or
		  to all radio listeners in the same media market. The most

		  pairs based on similar pretreatment covariates, then picks
		  one cluster in each pair at random for treatment, the other
		  cluster being assigned to control. Typically, group

		  requirement of probability sampling. A numerical example is
		  examined to illustrate the dangers in the use of

		  concludes with a summary of principles that we believe
		  should guide the practitioner of sample surveys of finite

	Abstract = {How do recipients view foreign aid? Systematic scholarship
		  on this topic is very li- mited. We provide a comparison of
		  mass and elite support for aid from a rando- mized field
		  experiment and survey done in Uganda in 2012. We asked
		  local village leaders, provincial governors, national
		  members of parliament, and more than 3,000 Ugandan citizens
		  to demonstrate support for aid. For two aid projects, we
		  randomly assigned exposure to different project funders,
		  including bilateral agencies, multila- teral organizations,
		  and the domestic government. We invited subjects to demon-
		  strate their levels of support or opposition to these
		  projects and donors by voicing their support to others,
		  signing a petition, and sending an SMS. For members of par-
		  liament we asked them to sign letters of support to donors
		  and the national presi- dent. We examine the differences in
		  attitudes and behavioral responses between mass and elite
		  recipients. We generally find that citizens strongly prefer
		  foreign aid over government programs, whereas elites
		  support, albeit more weakly, govern- ment programs over
		  foreign aid in most outcomes. We interpret this as evidence
		  that citizens see aid as an escape from clientelism, but
		  elites may perceive more avenues for the capture of aid
		  resources. 1},

@article{hassanein2003practicing,
	Abstract = {There is a tension regarding the potential of the
		  alternative agro-food movement to create meaningful change.
		  From one perspective, individual and organizational actors
		  working to change the dominant food system need to be
		  engaged on a daily basis in political and social struggles
		  and accomplish what is presently possible given existing
		  opportunities and barriers. From an alternate view, such
		  pragmatism is woefully inadequate for achieving the
		  complete transformation of the food and agriculture system
		  that many movement actors and academic analysts see as
		  necessary. This paper examines some of the issues
		  underlying this tension. It is argued that the
		  "sustainability" of food and agriculture systems is
		  understandably a contested concept because it inevitably
		  involves both conflicts over values and uncertainty about
		  outcomes. These same characteristics make democracy the
		  method of choice for the alternative agro-food movement,
		  and this paper discusses the emerging concept of "food
		  democracy" in order to elaborate upon its practical utility
		  with respect to collective action. The existing alternative
		  agro-food movement is the main source of the pressure to
		  democratize the agro-food system. While the movement in the
		  United States (and elsewhere) is very diverse in terms of
		  organizational forms and strategies, there are important
		  opportunities for developing coalitions among various
		  groups. Lastly, food democracy is discussed as a pragmatic
		  method for transforming the agro-food system.},

@article{heagzege:00,
	Abstract = {Hierarchical or {"}multilevel{"} regression models
		  typically parameterize the mean response conditional on
		  unobserved latent variables or {"}random{"} effects and
		  then make simple assumptions regarding their distribution.
		  The interpretation of a regression parameter in such a
		  model is the change in possibly transformed mean response
		  per unit change in a particular predictor having controlled
		  for all conditioning variables including the random
		  effects. An often overlooked limitation of the conditional
		  formulation for nonlinear models is that the interpretation
		  of regression coefficients and their estimates can be
		  highly sensitive to difficult-to-verify assumptions about
		  the distribution of random effects, particularly the
		  dependence of the latent variable distribution on
		  covariates. In this article, we present an alternative
		  parameterization for the multilevel model in which the
		  marginal mean, rather than the conditional mean given
		  random effects, is regressed on covariates. The impact of
		  random effects model violations on the marginal and more
		  traditional conditional parameters is compared through
		  calculation of asymptotic relative biases. A simple
		  two-level example from a study of teratogenicity is
		  presented where the binomial overdispersion depends on the
		  binary treatment assignment and greatly influences
		  likelihood-based estimates of the treatment effect in the
		  conditional model. A second example considers a three-level

		  likelihood principle follows from the conditionality
		  principle together with the sufficiency principle, has
		  caused much discussion among statisticians. Briefly, many
		  writers dislike the consequences of the likelihood
		  principle (among other things, confidence coefficients and
		  levels of tests are dismissed as meaningless), but at the
		  same time they feel that both the conditionality principle
		  and the sufficiency principle are intuitively obvious. In
		  the present article we give examples to show that the
		  conditionality principle should not be taken to be of
		  universal validity, and we discuss some consequences of
		  these examples.},

	Abstract = {An observational or nonrandomized study of treatment
		  effects may be biased by failure to control for some
		  relevant covariate that was not measured. The design of an
		  observational study is known to strongly affect its
		  sensitivity to biases from covariates that were not
		  observed. For instance, the choice of an outcome to study,
		  or the decision to combine several outcomes in a test for
		  coherence, can materially affect the sensitivity to
		  unobserved biases. Decisions that shape the design are,
		  therefore, critically important, but they are also
		  difficult decisions to make in the absence of data.We
		  consider the possibility of randomly splitting the data
		  from an observational study into a smaller planning sample
		  and a larger analysis sample, where the planning sample is
		  used to guide decisions about design. After reviewing the
		  concept of design sensitivity, we evaluate sample splitting
		  in theory, by numerical computation, and by simulation,
		  comparing it to several methods that use all of the data.
		  Sample splitting is remarkably effective, much more so in
		  observational studies than in randomized experiments:
		  splitting 1,000 matched pairs into 100 planning pairs and
		  900 analysis pairs often materially improves the design
		  sensitivity. An example from genetic toxicology is used to
		  illustrate the method.},

	Abstract = {We develop a new method for blocking in randomized

		  treatments. We analyze the following prob- lem: given a
		  threshold for the minimum number of units to be contained
		  in a block, and given a distance measure between any two
		  units in the finite population, block the units so that the
		  maximum distance between any two units within a block is
		  minimized. This blocking criterion can minimize covariate
		  imbalance, which is a common goal in experimental design.
		  Find- ing an optimal blocking is an NP-hard problem.
		  However, using ideas from graph theory, we provide the
		  first polynomial time approximately optimal blocking
		  algorithm for this problem. We derive the variances of
		  estimators for sample average treatment effects under the
		  Neyman-Rubin potential out- comes model for arbitrary
		  blocking assignments and an arbitrary number of treatments.

		  Does mass communication produce any long-term effects? How
		  should this decay color our understanding of the effects of
		  mass communication? We examine these questions with data
		  from the effects of advertising in the 2000 presidential
		  election and 2006 subnational elections, but argue that our
		  model and results are broadly applicable within the field
		  of political communication. We find that the bulk of the
		  persuasive impact of advertising decays quickly, but that
		  some effect in the presidential campaign endures for at
		  least 6 weeks. These results, which are similar in rolling
		  cross-section survey data and county-level data on actual
		  presidential vote, appear to reflect amix of memory-based
		  processing (whose effects last only as long as short-term
		  memory lasts) and online processing (whose effects are more
		  durable). Finally, we find that immediate effects of
		  advertising are larger in subnational than presidential
		  elections, but decay more quickly and more completely.},

@article{hollyer2011,
	Abstract = {Corruption is typically depicted as a result of one of two
		  factors: a lack of politial$\backslash$naccountability or
		  insufficient state capacity. Nonetheless, substantial
		  variation in$\backslash$ncorruption levels exists even
		  within the set of politically unaccountable
		  high-capacity$\backslash$nregimes. In this paper, we
		  examine a third determinant of corruption -- the
		  ideological$\backslash$nappeal of the government -- and
		  demonstrate that this variable can explain
		  variation$\backslash$nin the types and levels of corruption
		  experienced in politically unaccountable
		  regimes.$\backslash$nUsing a model of both moral hazard and
		  adverse selection, we predict that (1)
		  regimes$\backslash$nthat inspire the intense ideological
		  loyalty of the populace are likely to enjoy low
		  levels$\backslash$nof petty corruption and that (2)
		  autocratic regimes that enjoy such intense
		  support$\backslash$nfrom only a narrow segment of the
		  populace will erect credible anti-corruption
		  institutions.$\backslash$nPolitical corruption, by
		  contrast, need not covary with levels of
		  ideological$\backslash$nsupport. We illustrate the
		  mechanisms of our model through a series of case
		  studies$\backslash$nthat demonstrate the importance of
		  ideology in driving levels of corruption -- with
		  a$\backslash$nparticular focus on low levels of corruption
		  in `developmentalist' regimes. Finally,
		  we$\backslash$ndiscuss the relevance of our findings to
		  other -- democratic -- political settings.},

@article{hsu2013,
	Abstract = {In an observational study of treatment effects, subjects
		  are not randomly assigned to treatment or control, so
		  differing outcomes in treated and control groups may
		  reflect a bias from nonrandom assignment rather than a
		  treatment effect. After adjusting for measured pretreatment
		  covariates, perhaps by matching, a sensitivity analysis
		  determines the magnitude of bias from an unmeasured
		  covariate that would need to be present to alter the
		  conclusions of the naive analysis that presumes adjustments
		  eliminated all bias. Other things being equal, larger
		  effects tend to be less sensitive to bias than smaller
		  effects. Effect modification is an interaction between a
		  treatment and a pretreatment covariate controlled by
		  matching, so that the treatment effect is larger at some
		  values of the covariate than at others. In the presence of
		  effect modification, it is possible that results are less
		  sensitive to bias in subgroups experiencing larger effects.
		  Two cases are considered: (i) an a priori grouping into a
		  few categories based on covariates controlled by matching
		  and (ii) a grouping discovered empirically in the data at
		  hand. In case (i), subgroup specific bounds on p-values are
		  combined using the truncated product of p-values. In case
		  (ii), information that is fixed under the null hypothesis
		  of no treatment effect is used to partition matched pairs
		  in the hope of identifying pairs with larger effects. The
		  methods are evaluated using an asymptotic device, the
		  design sensitivity, and using simulation. Sensitivity
		  analysis for a test of the global null hypothesis of no
		  effect is converted to sensitivity analyses for subgroup
		  analyses using closed testing. A study of an intervention
		  to control malaria in Africa is used to illustrate.},

	Abstract = {We develop a Bayesian ``sum-of-trees'' model where each
		  tree is constrained by a regularization prior to be a weak
		  learner, and fitting and inference are accomplished via an
		  iterative Bayesian backfitting MCMC algorithm that
		  generates samples from a posterior. Effectively, BART is a
		  nonparametric Bayesian regression approach which uses
		  dimensionally adaptive random basis elements. Motivated by
		  ensemble methods in general, and boosting algorithms in
		  particular, BART is defined by a statistical model: a prior
		  and a likelihood. This approach enables full posterior
		  inference including point and interval estimates of the
		  unknown regression function as well as the marginal effects
		  of potential predictors. By keeping track of predictor
		  inclusion frequencies, BART can also be used for model-free
		  variable selection. BART's many features are illustrated
		  with a bake-off against competing methods on 42 different
		  data sets, with a simulation experiment and on a drug
		  discovery classification problem. Keywords: Bayesian

		  high-frequency trading practices in financial markets,
		  Kearns, Kulesza, and Nevmyvaka report the results of an
		  extensive empirical study estimating the maximum possible
		  profitability of such practices and arrive at figures that
		  are surprisingly modest. Their findings highlight the
		  tension between execution cost and trading horizon that is
		  confronted by high-frequency traders. They provide a

	Abstract = {The toll of civil conflict is largely borne by civilian
		  populations, as warring factions target noncombatants
		  through campaigns of violence. But significant variation
		  exists in the extent to which warring groups abuse the
		  vivilian population: across conflicts, across groups, and
		  within countries geographically and over time. Using a new
		  dataset on fighting groups in Sierra Leone, this article
		  analyzes the determinants of the tactics, strategies, and
		  behaviors that warring factions employ in their
		  relationships with noncombatants. We first describe a
		  simple logic of extraction which we use to generate
		  hypotheses about variation in levels of abuse across
		  fighting units. We then show that the most important
		  determinants of civilian abuse are internal to the
		  structure of the faction. High levels of abuse are
		  exhibited by warring factions that are unable to police the
		  behavior of their members because they are more ethnically
		  fragmented, rely on material incentives to recruit
		  participants, and lack mechanisms for punishing
		  indiscipline. Explanations that emphasize the importance of
		  local community ties and contestation do not find strong

	Abstract = {The game theoretic study of coalitions focuses on settings
		  in which commitment technologies are available to allow
		  groups to coordinate their actions. Analyses of such
		  settings focus on two questions. First, what are the
		  implications of the ability to make commitments and form
		  coalitions for how games are played? Second, given that
		  coalitions can form, which coalitions should we expect to
		  see forming? I examine classic cooperative and new
		  noncooperative game theoretic approaches to answering these
		  questions. Classic approaches have focused especially on
		  the first question and have produced powerful results.
		  However, these approaches suffer from a number of
		  weaknesses. New work attempts to address these shortcomings
		  by modeling coalition formation as an explicitly
		  noncooperative process. This new research reintroduces the
		  problem of coalitional instability characteristic of
		  cooperative approaches, but in a dynamic setting. Although
		  in some settings, classic solutions are recovered, in
		  others this new work shows that outcomes are highly
		  sensitive, not only to bargaining protocols, but also to
		  the forms of commitment that can be externally enforced.
		  This point of variation is largely ignored in empirical

		  some individuals take extraordinary risks by choosing to

		  this article, we begin to fill this gap through an

		  theories, suggesting that the rivalry between them is
		  artificial and that theoretical work has insufficiently
		  explored the interaction of various recruitment strategies.
		  At the same time, the empirical results challenge standard
		  interpretations of grievance-based accounts of
		  participation, as poverty, a lack of access to education,
		  and political alienation predict participation in both
		  rebellion and counterrebellion. Factors that are

	Abstract = {By pressuring governments to hold democratic elections and
		  by becoming directly involved in the electoral process
		  through technical assistance and funding or as election
		  monitors, international actors now play a visible role in
		  domestic elections and other democratic processes
		  throughout the developing world. Although scholars have
		  documented several macrolevel relationships between
		  international-level variables and movement toward
		  democracy, there has been little attention paid to the
		  microlevel effects of international involvement in the
		  democratization process. This article examines the effects
		  of international election observation as a prominent form
		  of international involvement in domestic elections and
		  exploits a natural experiment in order to test whether
		  international observers reduce election fraud. Using data
		  from the 2003 presidential elections in Armenia, the
		  article demonstrates that although observers may not
		  eliminate election fraud, they can reduce election-day
		  fraud at the polling stations they visit. The unusual
		  advantage of experiment-like conditions for this study
		  offers unique causal evidence that international actors can
		  have direct, measurable effects on the level of
		  election-day fraud and, by extension, on the
		  democratization process.},

@misc{imai2004,
	Abstract = {<p>Although not widely known until much later, Al Gore
		  received 202 more votes than George W. Bush on election day
		  in Florida. George W. Bush is president because he overcame
		  his election day deficit with overseas absentee ballots
		  that arrived and were counted after election day. In the
		  final official tally, Bush received 537 more votes than
		  Gore. These numbers are taken from the official results
		  released by the Florida Secretary of State's office and so
		  do not reflect overvotes, undervotes, unsuccessful
		  litigation, butterfly ballot problems, recounts that might
		  have been allowed but were not, or any other hypothetical
		  divergence between voter preferences and counted votes.
		  After the election, the New York Times conducted a six
		  month long investigation and found that 680 of the overseas
		  absentee ballots were illegally counted, and no partisan,
		  pundit, or academic has publicly disagreed with their
		  assessment. In this paper, we describe the statistical
		  procedures we developed and implemented for the Times to
		  ascertain whether disqualifying these 680 ballots would
		  have changed the outcome of the election. The methods
		  involve adding formal Bayesian model averaging procedures
		  to King's (1997) ecological inference model. Formal
		  Bayesian model averaging has not been used in political
		  science but is especially useful when substantive
		  conclusions depend heavily on apparently minor but

@misc{imai2004a,
	Abstract = {<p>Although not widely known until much later, Al Gore
		  received 202 more votes than George W. Bush on election day
		  in Florida. George W. Bush is president because he overcame
		  his election day deficit with overseas absentee ballots
		  that arrived and were counted after election day. In the
		  final official tally, Bush received 537 more votes than
		  Gore. These numbers are taken from the official results
		  released by the Florida Secretary of State's office and so
		  do not reflect overvotes, undervotes, unsuccessful
		  litigation, butterfly ballot problems, recounts that might
		  have been allowed but were not, or any other hypothetical
		  divergence between voter preferences and counted votes.
		  After the election, the New York Times conducted a six
		  month long investigation and found that 680 of the overseas
		  absentee ballots were illegally counted, and no partisan,
		  pundit, or academic has publicly disagreed with their
		  assessment. In this paper, we describe the statistical
		  procedures we developed and implemented for the Times to
		  ascertain whether disqualifying these 680 ballots would
		  have changed the outcome of the election. The methods
		  involve adding formal Bayesian model averaging procedures
		  to King's (1997) ecological inference model. Formal
		  Bayesian model averaging has not been used in political
		  science but is especially useful when substantive
		  conclusions depend heavily on apparently minor but
		  indefensible model choices, when model generalization is
		  not feasible, and when potential critics are more partisan
		  than academic. We show how we derived the results for the
		  Times so that other scholars can use these methods to make
		  ecological inferences for other purposes. We also present a
		  variety of new empirical results that delineate the precise
		  conditions under which Al Gore would have been elected
		  president, and offer new evidence of the striking
		  effectiveness of the Republican effort to convince local
		  election officials to count invalid ballots in Bush
		  counties and not count them in Gore counties.</p>},

	Abstract = {The item count technique is a survey methodology that is
		  designed to elicit respondents? truthful answers to
		  sensitive questions such as racial prejudice and drug use.
		  The method is also known as the list experiment or the
		  unmatched count technique and is an alternative to the
		  commonly used randomized response method. In this article,
		  I propose new nonlinear least squares and maximum
		  likelihood estimators for efficient multivariate regression
		  analysis with the item count technique. The two-step
		  estimation procedure and the Expectation Maximization
		  algorithm are developed to facilitate the computation.
		  Enabling multivariate regression analysis is essential
		  because researchers are typically interested in knowing how
		  the probability of answering the sensitive question
		  affirmatively varies as a function of respondents?
		  characteristics. As an empirical illustration, the proposed
		  methodology is applied to the 1991 National Race and
		  Politics survey where the investigators used the item count
		  technique to measure the degree of racial hatred in the
		  United States. Small-scale simulation studies suggest that
		  the maximum likelihood estimator can be substantially more
		  efficient than alternative estimators. Statistical
		  efficiency is an important concern for the item count
		  technique because indirect questioning means loss of
		  information. The open-source software is made available to
		  implement the proposed methodology.},

	Abstract = { An instrument or instrumental variable manipulates a
		  treatment and$\backslash$naffects the outcome only
		  indirectly through its manipulation of
		  the$\backslash$ntreatment. For instance, encouragement to
		  exercise might increase$\backslash$ncardiovascular fitness,
		  but only indirectly to the extent that
		  it$\backslash$nincreases exercise. If instrument levels are
		  randomly assigned to$\backslash$nindividuals, then the
		  instrument may permit consistent estimation$\backslash$nof
		  the effects caused by the treatment, even though the
		  treatment$\backslash$nassignment itself is far from random.
		  For instance, one can conduct$\backslash$na randomized
		  experiment assigning some subjects to
		  'encouragement$\backslash$nto exercise' and others to 'no
		  encouragement' but, for reasons of$\backslash$nhabit or
		  taste, some subjects will not exercise when encouraged
		  and$\backslash$nothers will exercise without encouragement;
		  none-the-less, such an$\backslash$ninstrument aids in
		  estimating the effect of exercise.
		  Instruments$\backslash$nthat are weak, i.e. instruments
		  that have only a slight effect on$\backslash$nthe
		  treatment, present inferential problems. We evaluate a
		  recent$\backslash$nproposal for permutation inference with
		  an instrumental variable$\backslash$nin four ways: using
		  Angrist and Krueger's data on the effects
		  of$\backslash$neducation on earnings using quarter of birth
		  as an instrument, following$\backslash$nBound, Jaeger and
		  Baker in using simulated independent
		  observations$\backslash$nin place of the instrument in
		  Angrist and Krueger's data, using
		  entirely$\backslash$nsimulated data in which correct
		  answers are known and finally using$\backslash$nstatistical
		  theory to show that \&quot;only\&quot; permutation
		  inferences$\backslash$nmaintain correct coverage rates. The
		  permutation inferences perform$\backslash$nwell in both
		  easy and hard cases, with weak instruments, as
		  well$\backslash$nas with long-tailed responses. Copyright

	Abstract = {An instrument or instrumental variable manipulates a
		  treatment and affects the outcome only indirectly through
		  its manipulation of the treatment. For instance,
		  encouragement to exercise might increase cardiovascular
		  fitness, but only indirectly to the extent that it
		  increases exercise. If instrument levels are randomly
		  assigned to individuals, then the instrument may permit
		  consistent estimation of the effects caused by the
		  treatment, even though the treatment assignment itself is
		  far from random. For instance, one can conduct a randomized
		  experiment assigning some subjects to 'encouragement to
		  exercise' and others to 'no encouragement' but, for reasons
		  of habit or taste, some subjects will not exercise when
		  encouraged and others will exercise without encouragement;
		  none-the-less, such an instrument aids in estimating the
		  effect of exercise. Instruments that are weak, i.e.
		  instruments that have only a slight effect on the
		  treatment, present inferential problems. We evaluate a
		  recent proposal for permutation inference with an
		  instrumental variable in four ways: using Angrist and
		  Krueger's data on the effects of education on earnings
		  using quarter of birth as an instrument, following Bound,
		  Jaeger and Baker in using simulated independent
		  observations in place of the instrument in Angrist and
		  Krueger's data, using entirely simulated data in which
		  correct answers are known and finally using statistical
		  theory to show that only permutation inferences maintain
		  correct coverage rates. The permutation inferences perform
		  well in both easy and hard cases, with weak instruments, as
		  well as with long-tailed responses.},

		  theory, yet its quantitative significance has rarely been
		  assessed. Using detailed plot-level data from rural
		  Pakistan, we find that non-contractible investment is
		  underprovided on tenanted land, even after controlling for
		  the endogeneity of leasing decisions. Our evidence also
		  indicates that moral hazard in investment effort alone
		  cannot explain this inefficiency. Instead, imperfect
		  commitment appears to be the driving mechanism, since even
		  plots taken on fixed rent contracts where all the rent is
		  paid upfront receive lower investment than owner-cultivated
		  plots. We further show that a considerable portion of the
		  variation in tenancy duration, and hence in the security of
		  tenure, is due to heterogeneity across landlords. One
		  interpretation of this finding is that landlord reputation
		  is important in mitigating hold-up.},

		  Unique data on monitoring frequency collected from

	Abstract = {Informal lenders appear to be thriving even in regions
		  where microfinance institutions (MFIs), such as the Grameen
		  Bank, have established lending programs. We suggest that an
		  explanation for this well-documented observation lies in
		  the ubiquitous use of regularly scheduled repayments by
		  MFIs. Borrowers are typically required to repay their loans
		  in tightly structured installments, beginning soon after
		  loan disbursement. This little- remarked aspect of the
		  repayment schedule is usually explained as inculcating
		  'fiscal discipline' among borrowers. We argue that an
		  alternative rationale for this loan repayment structure
		  lies in the difficulty of monitoring borrowers' actions.
		  The potential for moral hazard leads MFIs to use innovative
		  mechanisms, such as regularly scheduled repayments, which
		  indirectly coopt the better-informed informal lenders.
		  Conversely, this installment repayment structure allows
		  informal lenders to survive. Further, we show that this
		  linkage can not only expand the volume of informal lending,
		  but may also raise the interest rate in the informal
		  sector. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

		  for better quality and efficiency. In the past decade, more

		  benefits of attracting multinational corporations come at
		  tremendous political costs, arguing that democratic
		  political systems attract lower levels of international
		  investment than their authoritarian counterparts. Using
		  both cross-sectional and time-series cross-sectional tests
		  of the determinants of FDI for more than 100 countries, I
		  generate results that are inconsistent with these dire
		  predictions. Democratic political systems attract higher
		  levels of FDI inflows both across countries and within
		  countries over time. Democratic countries are predicted to
		  attract as much as 70 percent more FDI than their
		  authoritarian counterparts. In a final empirical test, I
		  examine how democratic institutions affect country
		  credibility by empirically analyzing the link between
		  democracy and sovereign debt risk for about eighty
		  countries from 1980 to 1998. These empirical tests
		  challenge the conventional wisdom on the preferences of

	Abstract = {There is a renewed interest in how political risk affects
		  multinational corporations operating in emerging markets.
		  Much of this research has focused on the relationship
		  between democratic institutions and flows of foreign direct
		  investment (FDI). Yet the existing studies suffer from data
		  problems that only allow for indirect evidence of the
		  relationship between political institutions and political
		  risk. In this paper I utilize price data from political
		  risk insurance agencies to directly test how domestic
		  political institutions affect the premiums multinationals
		  pay for coverage against government expropriations and
		  contract disputes. I find that democratic regimes reduce
		  risks for multinational investors, specifically through
		  increasing constraints on the executive. Utilizing
		  qualitative evidence from investors, insurers, and location
		  consultants, I explore the mechanisms linking democratic
		  regimes with lower levels of political risk. [ABSTRACT FROM

	Abstract = {There is a renewed interest in how political risk affects
		  multinational corporations operating in emerging markets.
		  Much of this research has focused on the relationship
		  between democratic institutions and flows of foreign direct
		  investment (FDI). Yet the existing studies suffer from data
		  problems that only allow for indirect evidence of the
		  relationship between political institutions and political
		  risk. In this paper I utilize price data from political
		  risk insurance agencies to directly test how domestic
		  political institutions affect the premiums multinationals
		  pay for coverage against government expropriations and
		  contract disputes. I find that democratic regimes reduce
		  risks for multinational investors, specifically through
		  increasing constraints on the executive. Utilizing
		  qualitative evidence from investors, insurers, and location
		  consultants, I explore the mechanisms linking democratic
		  regimes with lower levels of political risk. T},

		  Quarterly, doi: 10.1111/isqu.12015 {\copyright} 2013
		  International Studies AssociationPolitical scientists have
		  examined how domestic politics and the competition for
		  international capital affect the setting of national tax
		  rates. In this paper, I explore how political institutions,
		  specifically the level of democracy, affect firm-level
		  taxation across the world. I argue that electoral
		  competition leads democratic governments to higher levels
		  of taxation on firms. Using a data set on firm tax payments
		  on the foreign affiliates of US multinational corporations
		  from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, I show that there
		  are large variations within countries on the tax burdens
		  faced by firms that are not explained by national tax
		  rates. I find evidence that the mobility of the specific
		  investment project, the types of spillovers these
		  investments provide to a community, and attributes of the
		  parent firm are all important determinants of taxation.
		  While firm-level factors clearly affect corporate taxation,
		  I argue that democratic institutions limit the offering of
		  tax incentives and generate electoral benefits to policing
		  tax avoidance by multinational corporations. After
		  controlling for parent firm and foreign affiliate--level
		  factors, I find that democratic countries generate as much
		  as 26\% more tax revenues from multinational corporations
		  relative to authoritarian countries.},

	Abstract = {A strong statistical association between legislative
		  opposition in authoritarian regimes and investment has been
		  interpreted as evidence that authoritarian legislatures
		  constrain executive decisions and reduce the threat of

		  robust, scholars have not provided systematic evidence that
		  authoritarian parliaments are able to restrain the actions
		  of state leaders, reverse activities they disagree with, or
		  remove authoritarian leaders who violate the implied
		  power-sharing arrangement. This article shows that
		  authoritarian legislatures, by providing a forum for horse
		  trading between private actors, are better at generating
		  corporate governance legislation that protects investors
		  from corporate insiders than they are at preventing
		  expropriation by governments. The statistical analysis
		  reveals that the strength of authoritarian legislatures is

		  this essay reports data from the 2005 English and Welsh

		  governance is more representative than civic activities,

	Abstract = {Expanding access to financial services holds the promise
		  to help reduce poverty and spur economic development. But,
		  as a practical matter, commercial banks have faced
		  challenges expanding access to poor and low-income
		  households in developing economies, and nonprofits have had
		  limited reach. We review recent innovations that are
		  improving the quantity and quality of financial access.
		  They are taking possibilities well beyond early models
		  centered on providing "microcredit" for small business
		  investment. We focus on new credit mechanisms and devices
		  that help households manage cash flows, save, and cope with
		  risk. Our eye is on contract designs, product innovations,
		  regulatory policy, and ultimately economic and social
		  impacts. We relate the innovations and empirical evidence
		  to theoretical ideas, drawing links in particular to new
		  work in behavioral economics and to randomized evaluation
		  methods."},

	Abstract = {We challenge the conventional definition of corruption
		  through the analysis of legal forms of corruption, and by
		  devoting special attention to influence induced by the
		  private sector. This paper studies the determinants of the
		  world pattern of legal and illegal corruption by proposing
		  a simple theoretical model of endogenous corruption and
		  related legal framework, and its thorough empirical test.
		  Three types of equilibrium outcomes are identified: one
		  based on illegal corruption, where the elite does not face
		  any binding incentives to limit corruption; one centered
		  around legal corruption, where the elite must incur a cost
		  to legally protect corruption; and finally a no-corruption
		  outcome, where the population is able to effectively react
		  to corruption. Testable implications from the model are
		  derived based on country-wide parameters. Crucially, we use
		  a rich corporate survey, including 8,279 firms in 104
		  countries, tailored for this research, and featuring
		  measures of legal corruption that are novel to the
		  literature. The microdimension of the database enables
		  improving on familiar shortcomings associated with the use
		  of endogeneity-prone, country-wide indices of perceived
		  corruption. The empirical results, making use of a broad
		  range of proxies and sources, generally validate the
		  model's explanations.},

		  twenty years. In marketing, 1) the structural paradigm is
		  dominant, 2) the data are a lot better than in some fields

		  that the treatment and con- trol groups are balanced with
		  respect to all characteristics except the treatment. As
		  such, treatment effects can be estimated with a simple
		  difference of means-no other covariates are necessary.
		  Still, analysts often adjust using experimental data for
		  additional covariates with statistical models. In this
		  paper, we address the issue of adjustment with experimental
		  data. First, we outline the motivations for adjustment of
		  experimental. We then review design based and analytic
		  strategies for addressing these underlying motivations. We
		  offer a com- parison of the most common method of
		  adjustment---the standard least squares regression to
		  estimate an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model---to two
		  methods of statistical ad- justment that avoid ANCOVA's
		  strong functional form assumption: Rosenbaum's method of
		  covariate adjustment and matching. For all methods of
		  adjustment, we outline a design and analytic strategy that
		  maximizes transparency and illuminates whether inferences
		  are adjustment dependent. Finally, we evaluate these
		  methods of adjustment and demonstrate our design strategy
		  with an original experiment on racial priming.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Political scientists often turn
		  to natural experiments to draw causal inferences with
		  observational data. Recently, the regression discontinuity
		  design (RD) has become a popular type of natural experiment
		  due to its relatively weak assumptions. We study a special
		  type of regression discontinuity design where the
		  discontinuity in treatment assignment is geographic. In
		  this design, which we call the Geographic Regression
		  Discontinuity (GRD) design, a geographic or administrative
		  boundary splits units into treated and control areas, and
		  analysts make the case that the division into treated and
		  control areas occurs in an as-if random fashion. We show
		  how this design is equivalent to a standard RD with two
		  running variables, but we also clarify several
		  methodological differences that arise in geographical
		  contexts. We also offer a method for estimation of
		  geographically located treatment effects that can also be
		  used to validate the identification assumptions using
		  observable pretreatment characteristics. We illustrate our
		  methodological framework with a re-examination of the
		  effects of political advertisements on voter turnout during
		  a presidential campaign, exploiting the exogenous variation
		  in the volume of presidential ads that is created by media
		  market boundaries.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

		  evidence that national policymakers allocate resources
		  across regions based on political considerations, in
		  addition to any normative considerations of equity and
		  efficiency. In order to mitigate these political
		  compulsions, several federations around the world have
		  attempted to create independent constitutional bodies that
		  are responsible for determining federal transfers to
		  subnational jurisdictions. Khemani tests whether
		  constitutional rules indeed make a difference in curbing
		  political influence by contrasting the impact of political
		  variables on two types of intergovernmental transfers to
		  states in the Indian federation over a period of time,
		  1972-95. The pattern of evidence shows that transfers,
		  whose regional distribution is determined by political
		  agents, usually provide greater resources to state
		  governments that are politically affiliated with the
		  national ruling party and are important in maximizing the
		  party's representation in the national legislature. But the
		  political effect on statutory transfers, determined by an
		  independent agency with constitutional authority, is
		  strikingly contrary, with greater resources going to
		  unaffiliated state governments. The author argues that this
		  contrasting evidence indicates that constitutional rules
		  indeed restrict the extent to which partisan politics can
		  affect resources available to subnational governments.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines a puzzle in the political economy of
		  infrastructure in India---the co-existence of relatively
		  low shares of capital spending in public budgets alongside
		  evidence of large demand for village infrastructure from
		  poor voters. It argues that this pattern is due to
		  infrastructure projects being used at the margin for
		  political rent-seeking, while spending on employment and
		  welfare transfers are the preferred vehicles to win votes
		  for re-election. New suggestive evidence on the variation
		  of public spending composition across states, and within
		  states over time is offered that is consistent with this
		  argument. This evidence underscores a growing argument in
		  the development literature that the level and composition
		  of public spending per se may not be sufficient metrics to
		  assess the quality of public goods policies---greater
		  infrastructure spending in some contexts may go to
		  political rents rather than to the actual delivery of broad
		  public goods for growth and poverty reduction.},

		  politicians‚\"{A}\^{o} time horizons affect the differing

		  measuring government spending, AIDS policy, and political
		  constraints, the author tests the presumption that the
		  leader of a country can determine a country‚\"{A}\^{o}s
		  level of AIDS intervention. She looks at countries in
		  eastern and southern Africa to explore the relationship
		  between political institutions that constrain an
		  executive‚\"{A}\^{o}s time horizon (i.e., competitive
		  elections) and the level of the state‚\"{A}\^{o}s efforts
		  in the fight against AIDS. Her primary hypothesis is that
		  an executive with a shorter time horizon is less likely to
		  create policy or devote resources to intervene against
		  AIDS. The author finds that lengthening an
		  executive‚\"{A}\^{o}s time horizon increases the level of
		  government spending on health but that executives with
		  shorter time horizons tended to have more comprehensive
		  AIDS policy than their counterparts with longer time horizons.},

	Abstract = {We develop an approach to conducting large-scale
		  randomized public policy experiments intended to be more
		  robust to the political interventions that have ruined some
		  or all parts of many similar previous efforts. Our proposed
		  design is insulated from selection bias in some
		  circumstances even if we lose observations; our inferences
		  can still be unbiased even if politics disrupts any two of
		  the three steps in our analytical procedures; and other
		  empirical checks are available to validate the overall
		  design. We illustrate with a design and empirical
		  validation of an evaluation of the Mexican Seguro Popular
		  de Salud (Universal Health Insurance) program we are
		  conducting. Seguro Popular, which is intended to grow to
		  provide medical care, drugs, preventative services, and
		  financial health protection to the 50 million Mexicans
		  without health insurance, is one of the largest health
		  reforms of any country in the last two decades. The
		  evaluation is also large scale, constituting one of the
		  largest policy experiments to date and what may be the
		  largest randomized health policy experiment ever.},

	Abstract = {Social and medical scientists are often concerned that the
		  external validity of experimental results may be
		  compromised because of heterogeneous treatment effects. If
		  a treatment has different effects on those who would choose
		  to take it and those who would not, the average treatment
		  effect estimated in a standard randomized controlled trial
		  (RCT) may give a misleading picture of its overall impact
		  outside of the study sample. Patient preference trials
		  (PPTs), where participants' preferences over treatment
		  options are incorporated in the study design, provide a
		  possible solution. In this paper, we provide a systematic
		  analysis of PPTs based on the potential outcomes framework
		  of causal inference. We propose a general design for PPTs
		  with multi-valued treatments, where participants state
		  their preferred treatments and are then randomized into
		  either a standard RCT or a self-selection condition. We
		  derive nonparametric sharp bounds on the average causal
		  effects among each choice-based subpopulation of
		  participants under the proposed design. We also propose a
		  sensitivity analysis for the violation of the key
		  ignorability assumption sufficient for identifying the
		  target causal quantity. The proposed design and methodology
		  are illustrated with an original study of partisan news
		  media and its behavioral impact. (195 words)},

	Abstract = {The familiar logit and probit models provide convenient
		  settings for many binary response applications, but a
		  larger class of link functions may be occasionally
		  desirable. Two parametric families of link functions are
		  investigated: the Gosset link based on the Student t latent
		  variable model with the degrees of freedom parameter
		  controlling the tail behavior, and the Pregibon link based
		  on the (generalized) Tukey ?? family, with two shape
		  parameters controlling skewness and tail behavior. Both
		  Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods for estimation and
		  inference are explored, compared and contrasted. In
		  applications, like the propensity score matching problem
		  discussed below, where it is critical to have accurate
		  estimates of the conditional probabilities, we find that
		  misspecification of the link function can create serious
		  bias. Bayesian point estimation via MCMC performs quite
		  competitively with MLE methods; however nominal coverage of
		  Bayes credible regions is somewhat more problematic. ??

		  study vote-buying's effect on voter turnout in Kenya, using
		  a nationally representative survey that includes questions
		  about the country's 2002 presidential and parliamentary

		  voter turnout is complicated by the strategic nature of

		  statistical models as well as propensity score matching and

@article{kramon2012,
	Abstract = {African leaders are widely presumed to favor members of
		  their own ethnic groups with patronage resources. We assess
		  the empirical validity of this claim by studying ethnic
		  favoritism in the education sector in Kenya. We use data on
		  the educational attainment of more than fifty thousand
		  Kenyans dating back to the colonial era, as well as
		  information about the ethnic identities of Kenyan
		  presidents, cabinet members, and high-level education
		  bureaucrats since independence. We find that having a
		  coethnic as president during one's primary school-age years
		  is associated with about a one-quarter of a year increase
		  in years of primary schooling with and substantial
		  increases in the probability of attending and completing
		  both primary and secondary school. We also find that ethnic
		  favoritism extends beyond the president: coethnics of the
		  minister of education also acquire more schooling than
		  children from other ethnic groups. In contrast to the
		  findings of some recent studies, we find that multiparty
		  political competition has no impact on the degree of ethnic
		  favoritism by presidents and ministers of education. Nor
		  has ethnic favoritism in the education sector varied across
		  Kenya's presidents. However, we find that the effect of the
		  entire cabinet's ethnic composition does vary over time:
		  having more coethnics in the cabinet impacts educational
		  attainment during the multiparty era during the tenure of a
		  president of a relatively small ethnic group, which we
		  suggest may have generated incentives to allocate more
		  discretion over resources to ministers from other ethnic
		  communities and which may have induced these ministers to
		  be more redistributive with their spoils from office.
		  Having established the role of ethnic favoritism in
		  educational outcomes, we identify and provide suggestive
		  evidence about the possible mechanisms explaining these
		  patterns. We also highlight the substantive importance of
		  ethnic favoritism by comparing our estimated effects to
		  those estimated in studies of policy interventions designed
		  to increase educational achievement in the developing world
		  and by estimating the long-term impact of ethnic favoritism
		  through education on a number of long-term socio-economic
		  outcomes.},

	Abstract = {This paper offers the data analyst a range of practical
		  procedures for dealing with outliers in multilevel data. It
		  first develops several techniques for data exploration for
		  outliers and outlier analysis and then applies these to the
		  detailed analysis of outliers in two large scale multilevel
		  data sets from educational contexts. The techniques include
		  the use of deviance reduction, measures based on residuals,
		  leverage values, hierarchical cluster analysis and a
		  measure called DFITS. Outlier analysis is more complex in a
		  multilevel data set than in, say, a univariate sample or a
		  set of regression data, where the concept of an outlying
		  value is straightforward. In the multilevel situation one
		  has to consider, for example, at what level or levels a
		  particular response is outlying, and in respect of which
		  explanatory variables; furthermore, the treatment of a
		  particular response at one level may affect its status or
		  the status of other units at other levels in the model.},

	Abstract = {A Bayesian method is developed for estimating neural
		  responses to stimuli, using likelihood functions
		  incorporating the assumption that spike trains follow
		  either pure Poisson statistics or Poisson statistics with a
		  refractory period. The Bayesian and standard estimates of
		  the mean and variance of responses are similar and
		  asymptotically converge as the size of the data sample
		  increases. However, the Bayesian estimate of the variance
		  of the variance is much lower. This allows the Bayesian
		  method to provide more precise interval estimates of
		  responses. Sensitivity of the Bayesian method to the
		  Poisson assumption was tested by conducting simulations
		  perturbing the Poisson spike trains with noise. This did
		  not affect Bayesian estimates of mean and variance to a
		  significant degree, indicating that the Bayesian method is
		  robust. The Bayesian estimates were less affected by the
		  presence of noise than estimates provided by the standard
		  method.},

	Abstract = {Since Fisher's formulation in 1922 of a framework for
		  theoretical statistics, statistical theory has been
		  concerned primarily with the derivation and properties of
		  suitable statistical procedures on the basis of an assumed
		  statistical model (including sensitivity to deviations from
		  this model). Until relatively recently, the theory has paid
		  little attention to the question of how such a model should
		  be chosen. In the present paper, we consider first what
		  Fisher and Neyman had to say about this problem and in
		  Section 2 survey some contributions statistical theory has
		  made to it. In Section 3 we study a distinction between two
		  types of models (empirical and explanatory) which has been
		  discussed by Neyman, Box, and others. A concluding section
		  considers some lines of further work.},

	Abstract = {A new form of matching\^{a}€``optimal balanced risk set
		  matching\^{a}€``is applied in an observational study of a
		  treatment, cystoscopy and hydrodistention, given in
		  response to the symptoms of the chronic, nonlethal disease
		  interstitial cystitis. When a patient receives the
		  treatment at time t, that patient is matched to another
		  patient with a similar history of symptoms up to time t who
		  has not received the treatment up to time t; this is risk
		  set matching. By using a penalty function in integer
		  programming in a new way, we force the marginal
		  distributions of symptoms to be balanced in the matched
		  treated and control groups. Among all balanced matchings,
		  we pick the one that is optimal in the sense of minimizing
		  the multivariate pretreatment covariate distance within
		  matched pairs. Under a simple model for the treatment
		  assignment mechanism, we study the sensitivity of the
		  findings to hidden biases. In particular, we show that a
		  simple, conventional sensitivity analysis is appropriate
		  with risk set matching when the time to treatment follows a
		  proportional hazards model with a time-dependent unobserved
		  covariate.},

	Abstract = {Cross-national research on taxation is a growth industry
		  in political science. This article discusses key conceptual
		  and measurement issues raised by such studies. First, it
		  highlights the ways in which taxation has been studied as a
		  rich and varied concept, including as a component of the
		  state-building process, as a collective action problem,
		  and/or as a problem of distributive justice. Second, the
		  article identifies the central tradeoffs associated with
		  the construction of taxation indicators used to measure
		  such ideas. It discusses considerations such as which forms
		  of revenue should be included and which should not, whether
		  and how to standardize taxation measures, and how no
		  fine-tune measures through a clear specification of units,
		  universes, and measurement calibration. These choices have

		  in a range of empirical studies of economic growth,

		  in these works, we seek to situate such discussions within
		  a more thoroughgoing conceptual analysis. Specifically, we
		  argue that four conceptual approaches---demographic,
		  cognitive, behavioral, and institutional---have been used
		  to develop theories in which the mechanism that relates
		  causes to outcomes is ethnic political competition . Within
		  this literature, we believe that institutional approaches
		  have been relatively under-appreciated, and we attempt to
		  address that imbalance. We begin by critically reviewing
		  the three main ways in which ethnic variables have been
		  specified and operationalized, delineating the assumptions
		  and trade-offs underlying their use. Next, we describe an
		  institutional approach to the study of ethnic politics,
		  which focuses on the rules and procedures for
		  differentiating ethnic categories. We propose some new
		  indices based on this latter approach that might be
		  developed and used in future research. Subsequently, we
		  analyze the relationship between each of these approaches

	Abstract = {In the past two decades, social capital in its various
		  forms and contexts has emerged as one of the most salient
		  concepts in social sciences . While much excitement has
		  been generated, divergent views, perspectives, and
		  expectations have also raised the serious question : is it
		  a fad or does it have enduring qualities that will herald a
		  new intellectual enterprise? This presentation's purpose is
		  to review social capital as discussed in the literature,
		  identify controversies and debates, consider some critical
		  issues, and propose conceptual and research strategies in
		  building a theory. I will argue that such a theory and the
		  research enterprise must be based on the fundamental
		  understanding that social capital is captured from embedded
		  resources in social networks . Deviations from this
		  understanding in conceptualization and measurement lead to
		  confusion in analyzing causal mechanisms in the macro- and
		  microprocesses. It is precisely these mechanisms and
		  processes, essential for an interactive theory about
		  structure and action, to which social capital promises to
		  make contributions . The paper will begin by exploring the
		  nature of capital and various theories of capital, so that
		  social capital can be properly perceived and located . It
		  will then identify certain controversies which, unless
		  clarified or resolved, will hinder the development of a
		  theory and the research enterprise . By considering social
		  capital as assets in networks, the paper will discuss some
		  issues in conceptualizations, measurements, and causal
		  mechanisms (the factors leading to inequality of social
		  capital and the returns following investments in social
		  capital) . A proposed model will follow . The paper will
		  conclude by calling attention to the rise of a new form of
		  social capital, cybernetworks, and briefly suggesting how
		  research on this topic promises to make important
		  contributions to the research enterprise .},

		  Appl. Stat. (2008b) 2 176--196] critiqued OLS regression
		  adjustment of estimated treat- ment effects in randomized
		  experiments, using Neyman's model for random- ization
		  inference. This paper argues that in sufficiently large
		  samples, the sta- tistical problems he raised are either
		  minor or easily fixed. OLS adjustment improves or does not
		  hurt asymptotic precision when the regression includes a
		  full set of treatment-covariate interactions.
		  Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be
		  constructed with the Huber-White sandwich standard error
		  estimator. Even the traditional OLS adjustment has benign
		  large-sample prop- erties when subjects are randomly
		  assigned to two groups of equal size. The strongest reasons
		  to support Freedman's preference for unadjusted estimates
		  are transparency and the dangers of specification search.

	Abstract = {Attacking the common view that whiteness is a meaningless
		  category of identity, Lipsitz shows that public policy and
		  private prejudice insure that whites wind up on top of the
		  social hierarchy. <P>Passionately and clearly written, this
		  wide-ranging book probes into the social and material
		  rewards that accrue to "the possessive investment in
		  whiteness." Lipsitz sums up the ways that public policy has
		  virtually excluded communities of color from everything
		  that American society defines as desirable: first-rate
		  education, decent housing, asset accumulation, political
		  power, social status, satisfying work, and even the power
		  to shape and narrate their own history. White supremacy is
		  no thing of the past, no fringe movement. It is a pervasive
		  and pernicious system that restricts the political and
		  cultural agency of African-Americans, Asian-Americans and
		  Latinos every day. Unearned and unacknowledged, race-based
		  advantages, not greater merit or a superior work ethic,
		  account for white privilege. <P>Lipsitz's ultimate point is
		  not to condemn all white people as racists but to challenge
		  everyone to begin a principled examination of personal
		  actions and political commitments. Exposing the system of
		  unfairness is not enough. People of all groups-but
		  especially white people because they benefit from that
		  system-have to work toward eradicating the rewards of
		  whiteness.},

		  comparative power of arguments are con-$\backslash$nfronted
		  with two problems: statistical power and learning. As the
		  number of arguments$\backslash$nincreases and/or a sample
		  size decreases, the ability of conventional means tests and
		  regres-$\backslash$nsion models to uncover small but real
		  effects declines. We present a solution to this problem
		  of$\backslash$nthe pairwise comparison of arguments: the
		  Bradley-Terry model. Using a survey
		  experiment$\backslash$nconducted during a referendum on
		  electoral reform in the province of Ontario, Canada in
		  the$\backslash$nfall of 2007, we show how unstructured and
		  structured models can uncover information
		  about$\backslash$nthe power of arguments and its sources
		  undetected by more conventional methods. In
		  doing$\backslash$nso, we gain insight into the factors
		  which drive support or opposition for electoral reform.
		  We$\backslash$nconclude by discussing the limits and
		  further applications of these models.},

		  Using a survey experiment conducted during an electoral

		  demonstrate how unstructured and structured Bradley-Terry
		  models can be straightforwardly fitted and interpreted. In
		  doing so, we gain insight into the factors which determine
		  support for electoral reform. We identify a status quo bias
		  and find that power varies with mention of fairness, local
		  control over candidate selection, and the role of political
		  parties. We conclude by discussing the limits, extensions
		  and further applications of such models in electoral
		  studies and political science more broadly. ?? 2011

	Abstract = {Does lawmaker behavior influence electoral outcomes?
		  Observational studies cannot elucidate the effect of
		  legislative proposals on electoral outcomes, since effects
		  are confounded by unobserved differences in legislative and
		  political skill. We take advantage of a unique natural
		  experiment in the Canadian House of Commons that allows us
		  to estimate how proposing legislation affects election
		  outcomes. The right of noncabinetmembers to propose
		  legislation is assigned by lottery. Comparing outcomes
		  between thosewhowere granted the right to propose and
		  thosewho were not, we show that incumbents of the governing
		  party enjoy a 2.7 percentage point bonus in vote total in
		  the election following their winning the right to introduce
		  a single piece of legislation, which translates to a 7\%
		  increase in the probability of winning. The causal effect
		  results from higher likeability among constituents. These
		  results demonstrate experimentally that what politicians do
		  as lawmakers has a causal effect on electoral outcomes.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary
		  least squares (OLS) estimates are unbiased, but the usual
		  tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their
		  use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a
		  heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM),
		  however, are consistent even in the presence of
		  heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications
		  that use a HCCM appear to rely on the asymptotic version
		  known as HC0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that HC0
		  often results in incorrect inferences when N $\leq$ 250,
		  while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of
		  the HCCM, and especially a version known as HC3, work well
		  even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data
		  analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a HCCM
		  whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2)
		  the decision to use HCCM-based tests should not be
		  determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and
		  (3) when N $\leq$ 250, the HCCM known as HC3 should be
		  used. Since HC3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors
		  of statistical software to add this estimator to their
		  programs. },

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many children receive their care at local
		  hospitals outside of a large urban area. There may be
		  differences in the length of stay (LOS) between children
		  hospitalized in rural versus urban hospitals. This study
		  compared the differences in LOS, conditional LOS (CLOS),
		  odds of prolonged stay, and 21-day readmission rates for
		  children with 19 medical conditions and 9 surgical
		  procedures admitted to rural, community, and large urban
		  hospitals. METHODS: Discharge records for the
		  hospitalizations of children 1 to 17 years of age were
		  obtained from the New York Department of Public Health
		  Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and the
		  Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council for April
		  1996 to July 1998. The 19 medical and 9 surgical conditions
		  were identified with the principal condition and procedure
		  codes. Hospitals were classified into 1 of 5 geographic
		  categories on the basis of United States rural-urban
		  continuum codes, ie, large urban, suburban, moderate urban,
		  small urban, or rural. LOS was defined as the period of
		  time between hospital admission and discharge. Readmission
		  rates were calculated for 21 days after discharge from the
		  hospital. A prolonged stay for each condition was defined
		  as any admission lasting beyond the prolongation point, or
		  the day at which the rate of discharge began to decline, as
		  determined with the Hollander-Proschan statistic. This
		  aspect of LOS describes the ability of providers to treat
		  uncomplicated cases of that specific principle diagnosis.
		  CLOS, as a marker for the management of complicated cases,
		  was defined as the LOS beyond the prolongation point. Cox
		  and logistic regression models were developed to describe
		  the geographic effects on the 4 outcome variables, after
		  severity adjustment with 32 demographic and 11 comorbidity
		  variables and adjustment for hospital clustering. RESULTS:
		  Medical (N = 114,787) and surgical (N = 29,156) admissions
		  to rural hospitals (N = 12,367) had similar outcomes,
		  compared with all geographic categories except the large
		  urban category. Medical patients admitted to rural
		  hospitals had a shorter LOS (12\% increase in discharge
		  rate), a shorter CLOS (12\% increase in discharge rate),
		  and lower odds of prolonged stay (odds ratio: 0.80),
		  compared with those in large urban hospitals. Surgical
		  patients admitted to rural hospitals had a shorter LOS
		  (12\% increase in discharge rate) and lower odds of
		  prolonged stay (odds ratio: 0.81), compared with those in
		  large urban hospitals. For individual conditions, rural
		  hospitals in general had similar or improved LOS, compared
		  with all other hospitals in the 2 states. The addition of
		  hospital-level variables failed to change the results of
		  the primary models. CONCLUSIONS: In their treatment of
		  pediatric hospitalized patients, rural hospitals were not
		  significantly different from hospitals in all geographic
		  regions other than large urban areas. Rural hospitals
		  appear to deliver similar care, compared with nonrural
		  hospitals, for many of the common pediatric conditions
		  included in this study. Additional research is needed to
		  apply these results to other regions or states with
		  different geographic distributions of hospitals and
		  children, in order to determine the overall impact on the
		  regionalization of pediatric care.},

	Abstract = {Multivariate matching with doses of treatment differs from
		  the treatment-control matching in three ways. First, pairs
		  must not only balance covariates, but also must differ
		  markedly in dose. Second, any two subjects may be paired,
		  so that the matching is nonbipartite, and different
		  algorithms are required. Finally, a propensity score with
		  doses must be used in place of the conventional propensity
		  score. We illustrate multivariate matching with doses using
		  pilot data from a media campaign against drug abuse. The
		  media campaign is intended to change attitudes and
		  intentions related to illegal drugs, and the evaluation
		  compares stated intentions among ostensibly comparable
		  teens who reported markedly different exposures to the
		  media campaign. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright of Journal

	Abstract = {In an effort to detect hidden biases due to failure to
		  control for an unobserved covariate, some observational or
		  nonrandomized studies include two control groups selected
		  to systematically vary the unobserved covariate.
		  Comparisons of the treated group and two control groups
		  must, of course, control for imbalances in observed
		  covariates. Using the three groups, we form pairs optimally
		  matched for observed covariates-that is, we optimally
		  construct from observational data an incomplete block
		  design. The incomplete block design may use all available
		  data, or it may use data selectively to produce a balanced
		  incomplete block design, or it may be the basis for
		  constructing a matched sample when expensive outcome
		  information is to be collected only for sampled
		  individuals. The problem of optimal pair matching with two
		  control groups is shown by a series of transformations to
		  be equivalent to a particular form of optimal nonbipartite
		  matching, a problem for which polynomial time algorithms
		  exist. In our examples, we implement the procedure using a
		  nonbipartite matching algorithm due to Derigs. We
		  illustrate the method with data from an observational study
		  of the employment effects of the minimum wage.},

	Abstract = {An experimental unit is an opportunity to randomly apply
		  or withhold a treatment. There is interference between
		  units if the application of the treatment to one unit may
		  also affect other units. In cognitive neuroscience, a
		  common form of experiment presents a sequence of stimuli or
		  requests for cognitive activity at random to each
		  experimental subject and measures biological aspects of
		  brain activity that follow these requests. Each subject is
		  then many experimental units, and interference between
		  units within an experimental subject is likely, in part
		  because the stimuli follow one another quickly and in part
		  because human subjects learn or become experienced or
		  primed or bored as the experiment proceeds. We use a recent
		  fMRI experiment concerned with the inhibition of motor
		  activity to illustrate and further develop recently
		  proposed methodology for inference in the presence of
		  interference. A simulation evaluates the power of competing

	Abstract = {This article examines how repression in semiauthoritarian
		  regimes affects collective action by comparing antiwar
		  protesting during Russia's first (1994-96) and second
		  (1999-) Chechen wars. Vladimir Putin's creeping
		  authoritarianism acts as a "natural experiment" where we
		  can study collective action before, during, and after the
		  introduction of restrictive measures. Two key findings
		  emerge. First, despite the Kremlin's increasingly heavy
		  hand, antiwar actions have grown in size and frequency over
		  the course of Putin's tenure. Second, the movement's
		  failure to replicate its Yeltsin-era success in forcing a
		  peace, albeit temporary, in Chechnya is due to
		  organizational culture, not state repression. Indeed, the
		  antiwar movement's prevailing cultural norms have undercut
		  mobilization by locking activists into using symbolic
		  appeals that ring hollow among Russians. Activists are thus
		  unable to wield latent antiwar sentiment as a cudgel to
		  entrap the Kremlin into reversing course. This argument is
		  supported by a protest data set, primary documents,
		  interviews, and participant observation.},

	Abstract = {During the nineteenth century, states routinely defeated
		  insurgent foes. Over the twentieth century, however, this
		  pattern reversed itself, with states increasingly less
		  likely to defeat insurgents or avoid meeting at least some
		  of their demands. What accounts for this pattern of
		  outcomes in counterinsurgency (COIN) wars? We argue that
		  increasing mechanization within state militaries after
		  World War I is primarily responsible for this shift. Unlike
		  their nineteenth-century predecessors, modern militaries
		  possess force structures that inhibit information
		  collection among local populations. This not only
		  complicates the process of sifting insurgents from
		  noncombatants but increases the difficulty of selectively
		  applying rewards and punishment among the fence-sitting
		  population. Modern militaries may therefore inadvertently
		  fuel, rather than deter, insurgencies. We test this
		  argument with a new data set of 286 insurgencies
		  (1800--2005) and a paired comparison of two U.S. Army
		  divisions in Iraq (2003--2004). We find that higher levels
		  of mechanization, along with external support for
		  insurgents and the counterinsurgent's status as an
		  occupier, are associated with an increased probability of
		  state defeat. By contrast, we find only partial support for
		  conventional power- and regime-based explanations, and no
		  support for the view that rough terrain favors insurgent
		  success.},

	Abstract = {Does ethnicity matter for explaining violence during civil
		  wars? I exploit variation in the identity of soldiers who
		  conducted so-called ``sweep'' operations (zachistki) in
		  Chechnya (2000--5) as an empirical strategy for testing the
		  link between ethnicity and violence. Evidence suggests that
		  the intensity and timing of insurgent attacks are
		  conditional on who ``swept'' a particular village. For
		  example, attacks decreased by about 40\% after pro-Russian
		  Chechen sweeps relative to similar Russian- only
		  operations. These changes are difficult to reconcile with
		  notions of Chechen solidarity or different tactical
		  choices. Instead, evidence, albeit tentative, points toward
		  the existence of a wartime ``coethnicity advantage.''
		  Chechen soldiers, enmeshed in dense intraethnic networks,
		  are better positioned to identify insurgents within the
		  population and to issue credible threats against civilians
		  for noncooperation. A second mechanism----prior experience
		  as an insurgent----may also be at work. These findings
		  suggest new avenues of research investigating the
		  conditional effects of violence in civil wars.},

	Abstract = {A core proposition from decades of research on internal
		  wars asserts that democracies, with their casualty-averse
		  publics, accountable leaders, and free media, are uniquely
		  prone to losing counterinsurgency (COIN) wars. Yet one
		  should question this finding, for two reasons. First,
		  existing studies overwhelmingly adopt no-variance research
		  designs that only examine democracies, leaving them unable
		  to assess their performance relative to autocracies.
		  Second, these studies do not control for confounding
		  factors that bias causal estimates. Democracies, for
		  example, typically fight wars of choice as external
		  occupiers, while most autocracies face home-grown
		  insurgencies, a function in part of divergent levels of
		  state capacity possessed by democratic and autocratic
		  combatants. This study corrects for both problems using a
		  new dataset of insurgencies (1800-2005) and matching to
		  test whether democracies experience significantly higher
		  rates of defeat and shorter wars. No relationship between
		  democracy and war outcomes or duration is found once regime
		  type is varied and inferential threats are addressed.},

	Abstract = {Rapid development of the domestic private sector in
		  communist China and Vietnam has been offered as evidence
		  against a large literature that claims a solid legal
		  infrastructure is required for the financial sector to
		  contribute to economic development. One component of the
		  counterargument holds that relationship-based lending has
		  served as an effective substitute for legal institutions.
		  In this article, we challenge this assertion with empirical
		  findings that show bank credit allocation that relies
		  heavily on "connections" undermines the impact of finance
		  on investment growth. Our data come from Vietnam, where -
		  like China - the private sector and financial sector are
		  expanding dramatically but rule of law has not kept pace.
		  Although Vietnam's banking sector is in transition toward a
		  healthier system, it still allocates a disproportionate
		  share of credit to "connected" enterprises in less
		  competitive regions. We find that political connections, in
		  particular, are an ineffective tool for channeling bank
		  credit to the most profitable investors. Using a two-stage
		  empirical approach, we find evidence that banks place
		  greater value on connections than performance and that the
		  firms with greater access to bank loans are no more
		  profitable than firms without them. By some measures,
		  connected firms are even significantly less profitable. We
		  conclude by demonstrating that the most profitable
		  investors in Vietnam have forgone the formal banking
		  system, preferring to finance their activities out of
		  reinvested earnings or informal loans (JEL G21, G28, G30,

		  longevity and economic growth in an authoritarian regime is
		  to co-opt potential opposition by offering them limited

		  Assembly, where delegates question the prime minister and
		  Cabinet members on important issues of the day. Using a
		  content analysis of queries, we offer the first empirical
		  test of delegate behavior in nondemocratic parliaments. We
		  find that some delegates exhibit behavior consistent with
		  cooptation theory by actively participating in sessions,
		  demonstrating criticism of authorities, and responding to
		  the needs of local constituents. Such responsiveness,
		  however, is parameterized by regime rules for nominating,
		  electing, and assigning parliamentary responsibilities to

@article{mansuri2004b,
	Abstract = {Community Based Development (CBD) and its more recent
		  variant, Community Driven Development (CDD), are among the
		  fastest growing mechanisms for channeling development
		  assistance. To clarify concepts, CBD is an umbrella term
		  that refers to projects which actively include
		  beneficiaries in their design and management. CDD is a
		  term, originally coined by the World Bank, that refers to
		  CBD projects where communities have direct control over key
		  project decisions as well as the management of investment
		  funds. The remainder of the paper is organized into five
		  sections. In section 2, we preface a review of the evidence
		  by briefly examining the history of participatory
		  development and the move towards CBD as a key mechanism for
		  channeling development assistance. Section 3 examines the
		  literature on participatory development and collective
		  action with a view to understanding what is really meant by
		  `participation' and `social capital', what constitutes a
		  `community', and what are the likely limits and constraints
		  on community participation. In section 4, we review the
		  evidence on the effectiveness of CBD/CDD attempting to
		  answer some of the questions raised above. Section 5
		  focuses on the feasibility of sustainably scaling up
		  CBD/CDD, and Section 6 concludes by highlighting the main
		  results and identifying the gaps in our knowledge.
		  Community Based Development relies on ``communities'' to
		  use their ``social capital'' to organize themselves and
		  ``participate'' in development processes. Thus, concepts
		  such as ``participation'', ``community,'' and ``social
		  capital'' are critical to how CBD/CDD is both
		  conceptualized and implemented. Interestingly, however,
		  handbooks of CBD/CDD, guidelines, and terms of reference,
		  all use the concepts freely and uncritically assuming that
		  they are widely and uniformly understood. What each of
		  these concepts implies is, however, quite controversial. We
		  take them up in turn. In sum, there are two notes of
		  caution from these studies (like 'participation, the new
		  tyranny?': First, what is labelled a community, is often an
		  `endogenous' construct defined by the parameters of a
		  project, by project facilitators, or by the nature of
		  administrative or identity boundaries-rather than an
		  organic form.6 Second, the effectiveness of participatory
		  strategies may hinge on an explicit understanding of local
		  structures of power since they both limit and enhance the
		  prospects for participatory development.},

	Abstract = {Informal lenders with access to markets or capital often
		  find it attractive to delegate loan provision to downstream
		  lenders who have an information or enforcement advantage in
		  dealing with particular borrowers. In this paper we examine
		  the conditions under which such an arrangement is preferred
		  by two informal lenders, a landlord and a merchant, who
		  compete in loan provision to tenant farmers differentiated
		  by wealth. We show that credit layering is preferred only
		  when tenants are sufficiently poor. In this case, the
		  trader lends to tenant farmers via a contract with their
		  landlord. Otherwise, only the trader lends. As a
		  consequence, a pattern of borrowing emerges in which
		  relatively wealthy tenants borrow from merchants while poor
		  tenants borrow mainly from their landlords. Interlinkage
		  between land and credit thus arises only for a subset of
		  tenants and purely as a consequence of credit layering.
		  This pattern is shown to be supported empirically. ?? 2007

	Abstract = {Influenced by Amartya Sen, over the last decade, The World
		  Bank has allocated nearly US\$80 billion to local
		  participatory development projects targeting poverty,
		  improved public service delivery, and strengthened social
		  cohesion and government accountability. But the success of
		  these programs is hindered by both endogenous local factors
		  and flawed program design and implementation. Two
		  especially important local obstacles are (1) entrenched
		  interests of political agents, civil bureaucrats, and
		  non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with either
		  incentives to resist or capabilities to appropriate program
		  resources, and (2) poverty and illiteracy, as the poor and
		  illiterate participate less and benefit less from
		  participatory projects than do the wealthier, more
		  educated, and more connected. After reviewing hundreds of
		  participatory projects, three lessons are clear for program
		  planning. First, contextual factors like inequality,
		  history, geography, and political systems (among others)
		  are important. Second, communities do not necessarily have
		  a ready stock of 'social capital' to mobilize. Third,
		  induced participatory interventions work best when
		  supported by a responsive state -- donors cannot substitute
		  for a non-functional state, and successful programs combine
		  enlightened state action from above with social
		  mobilization from below. Future participatory development
		  projects would benefit substantially from revised planning
		  and considerably more attention paid to evaluation and
		  monitoring. Project managers have historically paid little
		  attention to context, monitoring, or evaluation, in part
		  because The World Bank's operational policies did not
		  provide incentives to do so. Donor agencies should also
		  exercise greater patience and allow for flexible, long-term
		  engagement to facilitate contextual and programmatic
		  learning, including learning from failure. Adapted from the

	Abstract = {In a comparison of a treatment group and a control group,
		  a difference in results can correspond to the effect of the
		  treatment; however, the difference might also be, at least
		  in part, a reflection of pretreatment differences between
		  the two populations. Covariance adjustment can reduce bias
		  in the estimate of the treatment effect (Cochran & Rubin,
		  1973); however, baseline group differences with respect to
		  unobserved covariates which cannot be controlled can lead
		  to hidden bias. This article presents a simple method which
		  uses omitted variable bias to assess the uncertainty of the
		  hidden bias by describing what scenarios regarding the
		  unobserved covariate can lead to a given level of hidden
		  bias. A comparison of a culturally sensitive AIDS video
		  education program and a standard AIDS video education
		  program is used as an illustration.},

	Abstract = {When employing model selection methods such as the Lasso
		  and the Adaptive Lasso, it is typical to estimate the
		  smoothing parameter by m-fold crossvalidation, e.g., m =
		  10. In problems where the true regression function is
		  sparse and the signals large, such crossvali- dation
		  typically works well, with the Adaptive Lasso being an
		  oracle method. However, in regression modeling of genomic
		  studies involving Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP),
		  the true regression functions, while thought to be sparse,
		  do not have large signals. We demonstrate empirically that
		  in such problems, the number of selected variables using
		  the Adaptive Lasso with 10-fold crossvalidation is a random
		  variable that has considerable and surprising variation.
		  Similar remarks apply to the Lasso. Our study strongly
		  questions the suitability of performing only a single run
		  of m-fold crossvalidation with any oracle method, and not
		  just the Adaptive Lasso.},

		  frozen entity, but is something intertwined with time and
		  thus ever changing - also when we are not occupying it.
		  Doreen's descriptions of her journey through England for

		  and the potential of space.</p><p></p><p>The way we think
		  about space matters. It inflects our understandings of the
		  world, our attitudes to others, our politics. It affects,
		  for instance, the way we understand globalisation, the way
		  we approach cities, the way we develop, and practice, a
		  sense of place. If time is the dimension of change then
		  space is the dimension of the social: the contemporaneous
		  co-existence of others. That is its challenge, and one that
		  has been persistently evaded. <b>For Space</b> pursues its
		  argument through philosophical and theoretical engagement,
		  and through telling personal and political reflection.
		  Doreen Massey asks questions such as how best to
		  characterise these so-called spatial times, how it is that
		  implicit spatial assumptions inflect our politics, and how
		  we might develop a responsibility for place beyond
		  place.</p><p></p><p>This book is "for space" in that it
		  argues for a reinvigoration of the spatiality of our
		  implicit cosmologies. <b>For Space </b>is essential reading
		  for anyone interested in space and the spatial turn in the
		  social sciences and humanities. Serious, and sometimes
		  irreverent, it is a compelling manifesto: for re-imagining
		  spaces for these times and facing up to their
		  challenge.</p>}},

	Abstract = {Purpose -- This paper aims to present selected findings of
		  a recent study of serendipity in information seeking,
		  exploring the paradox of control inherent in the concept of
		  ``seeking serendipity''. Design/methodology/approach --
		  After providing an overview of the research study, the
		  paper locates the research findings in the context of the
		  literature. The discussion explores the research findings
		  in relation to both the paradox of control and the related
		  concept of ``seeking serendipity''. Findings -- The
		  definition/description of serendipity is examined, the
		  concept of process-perception duality is introduced, and
		  links with the literature are explored. The discussion
		  reassesses the paradox of control in light of the research
		  findings, raising the possibility that information literacy
		  educators have a role to play in developing the perception
		  aspect of serendipity. Practical implications -- The paper
		  proposes that, despite the possibly uncomfortable
		  challenges presented by the paradox of control, serendipity
		  deserves more recognition in professional practice.
		  Increased acknowledgement and understanding of serendipity
		  may enable professional practitioners to function more
		  effectively in the unpredictable, dynamic environment that
		  informs the reality of information seeking.
		  Originality/value -- The paper adds to the limited existing
		  empirical research investigating serendipity, increasing
		  both academic and practical understanding of the
		  phenomenon. In particular, the introduction of the concept
		  of process-perception duality provides a useful grounding
		  for future research. Keywords Information literacy,
		  Information research, Individual behaviour Paper type

		  organizations has normally assumed a close link between the
		  frustrations or grievances of a collectivity of actors and
		  the growth and decline of movement activity. Questioning
		  the theoretical centrality of this assumption directs
		  social movement analysis away from its heavy emphasis upon
		  the social psychology of social movement participants; it
		  can then be more easily integrated with structural theories
		  of social process. This essay presents a set of concepts
		  and related propositions drawn from a resource mobilization
		  perspective. It emphasizes the variety and sources of
		  resources; the relationship of social movements to the
		  media, authorities, and other parties; and the interaction
		  among movement organizations. Propositions are developed to
		  explain social movement activity at several levels of
		  inclusiveness-the social movement sector, the social
		  movement industry, and social movement organization.},

	Abstract = {What happens to a society that has too many men? In this
		  provocative book, Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer argue
		  that, historically, high male-to-female ratios often
		  trigger domestic and international violence. Most violent
		  crime is committed by young unmarried males who lack stable
		  social bonds. Although there is not always a direct
		  cause-and-effect relationship, these surplus men often play
		  a crucial role in making violence prevalent within society.
		  Governments sometimes respond to this problem by enlisting
		  young surplus males in military campaigns and high-risk
		  public works projects. Countries with high male-to-female
		  ratios also tend to develop authoritarian political
		  systems.
		  
		  Hudson and den Boer suggest that the sex ratios of many
		  Asian countries, particularly China and India -- which
		  represent almost 40 percent of the world's population --
		  are being skewed in favor of males on a scale that may be
		  unprecedented in human history. Through offspring sex
		  selection (often in the form of sex-selective abortion and
		  female infanticide), these countries are acquiring a
		  disproportionate number of low-status young adult males,
		  called "bare branches" by the Chinese.
		  
		  Hudson and den Boer argue that this surplus male population
		  in Asia's largest countries threatens domestic stability
		  and international security. The prospects for peace and
		  democracy are dimmed by the growth of bare branches in
		  China and India, and, they maintain, the sex ratios of
		  these countries will have global implications in the
		  twenty-first century.},

		  group of conflicts, both intrastate and interstate, that
		  seem destined never to end. From Kashmir to
		  Nagorno-Karabakh, Colombia to Sudan, the Korean Peninsula
		  to the Middle East, these deeply entrenched, intermittently
		  violent conflicts have so far resisted all outside efforts
		  to resolve them.What lessons aside from the apparent
		  futility of mediation can such dismal situations possibly
		  offer? As the distinguished contributors to "Grasping the
		  Nettle" make plain, this is not a rhetorical question.
		  Unyielding conflicts offer numerous insights not only about
		  the sources of intractability but also about such facets of
		  mediation and conflict management as how to gain leverage,
		  when to engage and disengage, how to balance competing
		  goals, and who to enlist to play supporting roles.The first
		  part of this eye-opening volume identifies and analyzes the
		  defining characteristics and underlying dynamics of
		  intractable conflicts. The second part turns the spotlight
		  on no fewer than eight current cases, in each instance
		  chronicling the conflict's evolution, evaluating the
		  internal and external factors that have conspired to
		  prevent a settlement, and assessing whether past
		  peacemaking initiatives have in fact only aggravated the

		  In such forms as boycotts, when consumers refuse to buy, or

		  This book opens readers' eyes to a new way of viewing

	Abstract = {The paper examines the aestheticisation of food in the
		  context of 'eating out' and distinguishes two main
		  aesthetic types: first, an 'aesthetic of entertainment' in
		  which food quality is secondary to the restaurant
		  experience; second, a 'gastronomic aesthetic' in which the
		  quality of food, notably seasonality and freshness, is seen
		  as primary. Having distinguished the two types, the paper
		  then investigates the second - the gastronomic aesthetic -
		  through the case study of Slow Food in Tuscany. The Slow
		  Food movement seeks to heighten the aesthetic appreciation
		  of typical products and works mainly through local groups
		  and typical restaurants. Through the in-depth analysis of
		  one such restaurant, the paper outlines three main strands
		  in the gastronomic aesthetic: a practical aesthetics of
		  restaurant organisation; an aesthetical-ethic of typical
		  foods; and, an aesthetic of 'connectedness' or
		  'embeddedness' in which the food is seen as a reflection of
		  surrounding socio-economic and ecological relationships.
		  The paper concludes by drawing out the implications of the
		  study of aesthetics for rural sociology.},

	Abstract = {Why were advanced industrial states able to keep their
		  economies relatively open to foreign trade in the 1970s and
		  the early 1980s, despite declining U.S. hegemony and
		  increasing economic difficulties? This article argues that
		  an international-level change affected domestic trade
		  politics and contributed to the maintenance of a liberal
		  trading system. Examining the United States and France, the
		  argument proceeds in two steps, showing first how domestic
		  trade politics were changed and second how this change
		  affected the policy process. Initially, I argue that
		  aspects of the increased international economic
		  interdependence of the postwar period altered domestic
		  trade politics by creating new, anti-protectionist
		  preferences among certain firms. Firms with extensive
		  international ties through exports, multinational
		  production, and global intra-firm trade have come to oppose
		  protectionism, since it is very costly for them. Evidence

		  countries. Trade policy structures in neither country

	Abstract = {Global economic interdependence has created incentives for
		  greater international economic co‐operation. In many
		  instances, these incentives have led states to accept
		  important and controversial co‐operative agreements,
		  despite their costs. A crucial form of contemporary
		  international economic policy co‐operation is the
		  development of regional patterns of economic integration,
		  exemplified by the NAFTA accord and the Maastricht Treaty
		  on European Monetary Union (EMU). Why did countries choose
		  to co‐operate in NAFTA and the EMU, especially given the
		  costs? This question is addressed in three parts. First,
		  why did political leaders initiate these negotiations?
		  Given the costs of such far‐reaching accords, why were
		  leaders interested in pursuing them? The second issue is
		  why were the countries able to reach agreement? A number of
		  factors, such as the end of the Cold War and the economic
		  difficulties experienced by the advanced industrial
		  countries after 1987, could have undermined such
		  co‐operation. Finally, what made domestic ratification
		  possible? Political leaders who negotiated NAFTA and EMU
		  had to obtain domestic approval from their legislatures or
		  electorates. Ratification proved to be a problem in both
		  agreements. The answers to these questions lie in the
		  intersection of domestic and international politics.
		  International economic co‐operation results from the
		  calculations of political leaders, whose first priority is
		  getting re‐elected, and is constrained by the need for
		  domestic ratification of any agreement negotiated. These
		  domestic factors are, however, linked to international
		  ones. The political calculations of leaders about
		  initiation and ratification depend on the extent of
		  international economic ties that a country possesses.
		  Heightened economic openness meant that leaders had to seek
		  joint solutions to their economic problems in order to
		  survive politically. Co‐operation is inextricably linked
		  to the electoral calculus of political leaders.},

		  Institutionsare the means by which the diverse preferences
		  of individuals are aggregated into choices or outcomes for
		  the collective. (760-761) Institutions both shape and
		  reflect the strategic interaction among agents. (761)
		  Institutions challenge two main tents of IR theory o States

		  also important Relaxing the Assumption of the State as a
		  Unitary Actor The national interest is now a contested
		  term. (772) o The national interests cannot be assumed o
		  Governments (i.e., domestic decision-makers) become the
		  main actors in the international system A major problem for
		  theory building has been to develop a systematic way to
		  explore which and how domestic factors affect international
		  politics. (773) o Both domestic and international politics
		  are somewhere in between anarchy and hierarchythey are

		  part of the domestic struggle for power over collective

		  Mearsheimer (1994, 7): Realists maintain that international
		  institutions are basically a reflection of the distribution
		  of power in the world. They are based on the
		  self-interested calculations of great powers, and they have
		  no independent effect on state behavior. Institutionalism
		  allows us to speak with a common language when discussing
		  domestic and international institutions, giving us more
		  leverage to explain international relations o Institutions,
		  whether domestic or not, act to aggregate diverse
		  preferences into a collective outcome. (780) Comparative
		  analysis of institutions seems especially important because
		  it avoids the post hoc quality of some institutional
		  research. If one can show that different institutions
		  result in different outcomes and the conditions under which
		  those different institutions might be optimal, then both a

	Abstract = {A third of electricity in India is lost each year, where
		  losses refer to power that is supplied but not billed.
		  Utilizing data from the power corporation of Uttar Pradesh,
		  India's most populous state, we study the politics of
		  electricity losses. Examining annual data over four
		  decades, we document that UP's electricity losses tend to
		  increase in periods immediately prior to state assembly
		  elections. Drawing upon geographically disaggregated data
		  for the period 2000-09, we observe higher line losses just
		  prior to the 2002 and 2007 state elections. Our analysis
		  shows that the incumbent party was more likely to retain
		  the assembly seat as line losses in the locality increased.
		  We interpret these results as corroboration that political
		  parties deliberately redirect electricity to flat rate and
		  unbilled users in a context of chronically inadequate
		  supply. Political factors appear to affect line losses in
		  ways that technical and economic factors alone cannot
		  explain. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Experimenters often use post-stratification to adjust
		  estimates. Post-stratification is akin to blocking, except
		  that the number of treated units in each stratum is a
		  random variable because stratification occurs after
		  treatment assignment. We analyse both post-stratification
		  and blocking under the Neyman--Rubin model and compare the
		  efficiency of these designs.We derive the variances for a
		  post-stratified estimator and a simple difference-in-means
		  estimator under different randomization schemes.
		  Post-stratification is nearly as efficient as blocking: the
		  difference in their variances is of the order of 1=n2, with
		  a constant depending on treatment proportion.
		  Post-stratification is therefore a reasonable alternative
		  to blocking when blocking is not feasible. However, in
		  finite samples, post-stratification can increase variance
		  if the number of strata is large and the strata are poorly
		  chosen.To examine why the estimators' variances are
		  different, we extend our results by conditioning on the
		  observed number of treated units in each stratum.
		  Conditioning also provides more accurate variance estimates
		  because it takes into account how close (or far) a realized
		  random sample is from a comparable blocked experiment. We
		  then show that the practical substance of our results
		  remains under an infinite popula- tion sampling model.
		  Finally, we provide an analysis of an actual experiment to
		  illustrate our analytical results.},

	Abstract = {In typical political experiments, researchers randomize a
		  set of households, precincts, or individuals to treatments
		  all at once, and characteristics of all units are known at
		  the time of randomization. However, in many other
		  experiments, subjects "trickle in" to be randomized to
		  treatment conditions, usually via complete randomization.
		  To take advantage of the rich background data that
		  researchers often have (but underutilize) in these
		  experiments, we develop methods that use continuous
		  covariates to assign treatments sequentially. We build on
		  biased coin and minimization procedures for discrete
		  covariates and demonstrate that our methods outperform
		  complete randomization, producing better covariate balance
		  in simulated data. We then describe how we selected and
		  deployed a sequential blocking method in a clinical trial
		  and demonstrate the advantages of our having done so.
		  Further, we show how that method would have performed in
		  two larger sequential political trials. Finally, we compare
		  causal effect estimates from differences in means,
		  augmented inverse propensity weighted estimators, and
		  randomization test inversion.},

	Abstract = {School-effects research in sociology cannot be separated
		  from concerns about causality. Purely descriptive modeling
		  justifications are untenable. Focusing on the Catholic
		  school effect on learning, this article demonstrates an
		  approach that places regression modeling strategies within
		  a specific and well-developed framework for thinking about
		  causality. While regression models should properly remain
		  the workhorse methodology for school-effects research,
		  regression estimates should more often be subject to
		  exacting interpretations and presented alongside
		  alternative estimates of more specific parameters of
		  interest. In this demonstration, propensity- score matching
		  estimates of the Catholic school effect for the Catholic
		  schooled are provided to supplement the estimates obtained
		  by regression models. Although subject to their own set of
		  weaknesses, the matching estimates suggest that the
		  Catholic school effect is the strongest among those
		  Catholic school students who, according to their observed
		  characteristics, are least likely to attend Catholic
		  schools. Four alternative explanations are offered for this
		  finding, each of which should be pursued in further
		  research.},

		  popularity, sociologists have returned to matching as a
		  research methodology. In this article, advances over the
		  past two decades in matching estimators are explained, and
		  the practical limitations of matching techniques are
		  emphasized. The authors introduce matching methods by
		  focusing first on ideal scenarios in which stratification
		  and weighting procedures warrant causal inference. Then,
		  they discuss how matching is often undertaken in practice,
		  offering an overview of the most prominent data analysis
		  routines. With four hypothetical examples, they demonstrate
		  how the assumptions behind matching estimators often break
		  down in practice. Even so, the authors argue that matching
		  techniques can be used effectively to strengthen the
		  prosecution of causal questions in sociology. },

@article{mund:78,
	Abstract = {In empirical analysis of data consisting of repeated
		  observations on economic units (time series on a cross
		  section) it is often assumed that the coefficients of the
		  quantitative variables (slopes) are the same, whereas the
		  coefficients of the qualitative variables (intercepts or
		  effects) vary over units or periods.This is the
		  constant-slope variable-intercept framework. In such an
		  analysis an explicit account should be taken of the
		  statistical dependence that exists between the quantitative
		  variables and the effects. It is shown that when this is
		  done, the random effect approach and the fixed effect
		  approach yield the same estimate for the slopes, the
		  {"}within{"} estimate. Any matrix combination of the
		  {"}within{"} and {"}between{"} estimates is generally
		  biased. When the {"}within{"} estimate is subject to a
		  relatively large error a minimum mean square error can be
		  applied, as is generally done in regression analysis. Such
		  an estimator is developed here from a somewhat different
		  point of departure.},

	Abstract = {Our first purpose was to determine whether, in the context
		  of a group-randomized trial (GRT) with Gaussian errors,
		  permutation or mixed-model regression methods fare better
		  in the presence of measurable confounding in terms of their
		  Monte Carlo type I error rates and power. Our results
		  indicate that given a proper randomization, the type I
		  error rate is similar for both methods, whether unadjusted
		  or adjusted, even in small studies. However, our results
		  also show that should the investigator face the unfortunate
		  circumstance in which modest confounding exists in the only
		  realization available, the unadjusted analysis risks a type
		  I error; in this regard, there was little to distinguish
		  the two methods. Finally, our results show that power is
		  similar for the two methods and, not surprisingly, better
		  for the adjusted tests.Our second purpose was to examine
		  the relative performance of permutation and mixed-model
		  regression methods in the context of a GRT when the
		  normality assumptions underlying the mixed model are
		  violated. Published studies have examined the impact of
		  violation of this assumption at the member level only. Our
		  findings indicate that both methods perform well when the
		  assumption is violated so long as the ICC is very small and
		  the design is balanced at the group level. However, at
		  ICC?0.01, the permutation test carries the nominal type I
		  error rate while the model-based test is conservative and
		  so less powerful. Binomial group- and member-level errors
		  did not otherwise change the relative performance of the
		  two methods with regard to confounding.},

@article{mvukiyehe2010a,
	Abstract = {We use original survey data and administrative data from
		  post-war Liberia to test a theory of the micro-level
		  impacts of peacekeeping. The theory proposes that through
		  the creation of local security bubbles and also through
		  direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to
		  economic and social revitalization that may contribute to
		  more durable peace. This theory guides the design of
		  current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has
		  been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping's
		  well-documented association with more durable peace. We
		  identify local impacts of deployment bases by exploiting
		  the fact that peacekeepers had limited information when
		  selecting base localities, using coarsened exact matching
		  to identify sets of communities that should have been
		  equally likely to receive bases, and then using regression
		  to clean up residual imbalances. Our evidence paint a
		  complex picture that deviates substantially from the
		  theory. We do not find evidence for local security bubbles
		  around deployment base areas, and we do not find that
		  deployments were substantial contributors to local social
		  infrastructure. In addition, we find a negative
		  relationship between deployment basing locations and NGO
		  contributions to social infrastructure. Nonetheless, we
		  find that deployments do seem to stimulate local markets,
		  leading to better employment possibilities and
		  substantially higher incomes. The result is something of a
		  puzzle, suggesting that more work needs to be done on other
		  types of direct assistance by peacekeeping contingents -
		  e.g. the impact of mission procurement and routine spending
		  by those associated with the mission. Also, the findings
		  with respect to NGO activities suggest that this is an
		  important factor that past case studies and cross-national
		  studies have not taken into account sufficiently.},

	Abstract = {In the U.S., we're bombarded with nutritional advice--the
		  work, we assume, of reliable authorities with our best
		  interests at heart. Far from it, says Marion Nestle, whose
		  <I>Food Politics</I> absorbingly details how the food
		  industry--through lobbying, advertising, and the co-opting
		  of experts--influences our dietary choices to our
		  detriment. Central to her argument is the American "paradox
		  of plenty," the recognition that our food abundance (we've
		  enough calories to meet every citizen's needs twice over)
		  leads profit-fixated food producers to do everything
		  possible to broaden their market portion, thus swaying us
		  to eat <I>more</I> when we should do the opposite. The
		  result is compromised health: epidemic obesity to start,
		  and increased vulnerability to heart and lung disease,
		  cancer, and stroke--reversible if the constantly suppressed
		  "eat less, move more" message that most nutritionists shout
		  could be heard. <p> Nestle, nutrition chair at New York
		  University and editor of the 1988 Surgeon General Report,
		  has served her time in the dietary trenches and is ideally
		  suited to revealing how government nutritional advice is
		  watered down when a message might threaten industry sales.
		  (Her report on byzantine nutritional food-pyramid
		  rewordings to avoid "eat less" recommendations is both
		  predictable and astonishing.) She has other "war stories,"
		  too, that involve marketing to children in school (in the
		  form of soft-drink "pouring rights" agreements, hallway
		  advertising, and fast-food coupon giveaways), and
		  diet-supplement dramas in which manufacturers and the
		  government enter regulation frays, with the industry
		  championing "free choice" even as that position counters
		  consumer protection. Is there hope? "If we want to
		  encourage people to eat better diets," says Nestle, "we
		  need to target societal means to counter food industry
		  lobbying and marketing practices as well as the education
		  of individuals." It's a telling conclusion in an engrossing
		  and masterfully panoramic expos\'{e}. <I>--Arthur Boehm</I>
		  An accessible and balanced account, <I>Food Politics
		  </I>laid the groundwork for today's food revolution and
		  changed the way we respond to food industry marketing
		  practices. Now, a new introduction and concluding chapter
		  bring us up to date on the key events in that movement.
		  This pathbreaking, prize-winning book helps us understand
		  more clearly than ever before what we eat and why.},

	Abstract = {IMPORTANCE: More than 300,000 hip fractures occur each
		  year in the United States. Recent practice guidelines have
		  advocated greater use of regional anesthesia for hip
		  fracture surgery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To
		  test the association of regional (ie, spinal or epidural)
		  anesthesia vs general anesthesia with 30-day mortality and
		  hospital length of stay after hip
		  fracture.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN, SETTING, AND
		  PATIENTS: We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study
		  involving patients 50 years or older who were undergoing
		  surgery for hip fracture at general acute care hospitals in
		  New York State between July 1, 2004, and December 31, 2011.
		  Our main analysis was a near-far instrumental variable
		  match that paired patients who lived at different distances
		  from hospitals that specialized in regional or general
		  anesthesia. Supplementary analyses included a
		  within-hospital match that paired patients within the same
		  hospital and an across-hospital match that paired patients
		  at different hospitals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPOSURES:
		  Spinal or epidural anesthesia; general
		  anesthesia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND
		  MEASURES: Thirty-day mortality and hospital length of stay.
		  Because the distribution of length of stay had long tails,
		  we characterized this outcome using the Huber M estimate
		  with Huber weights, a robust estimator similar to a trimmed
		  mean.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 56,729 patients,
		  15,904 (28\%) received regional anesthesia and 40,825
		  (72\%) received general anesthesia. Overall, 3032 patients
		  (5.3\%) died. The M estimate of the length of stay was 6.2
		  days (95\% CI, 6.2 to 6.2). The near-far matched analysis
		  showed no significant difference in 30-day mortality by
		  anesthesia type among the 21,514 patients included in this
		  match: 583 of 10,757 matched patients (5.4\%) who lived
		  near a regional anesthesia-specialized hospital died vs 629
		  of 10,757 matched patients (5.8\%) who lived near a general
		  anesthesia-specialized hospital (instrumental variable
		  estimate of risk difference, -1.1\%; 95\% CI, -2.8 to 0.5;
		  P = .20). Supplementary analyses of within and across
		  hospital patient matches yielded mortality findings to be
		  similar to the main analysis. In the near-far match,
		  regional anesthesia was associated with a 0.6-day shorter
		  length of stay than general anesthesia (95\% CI, -0.8 to
		  -0.4, P < .001). Supplementary analyses also showed
		  regional anesthesia to be associated with shorter length of
		  stay, although the observed association was smaller in
		  magnitude than in the main
		  analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND
		  RELEVANCE: Among adults in acute care hospitals in New York
		  State undergoing hip repair, the use of regional anesthesia
		  compared with general anesthesia was not associated with
		  lower 30-day mortality but was associated with a modestly
		  shorter length of stay. These findings do not support a
		  mortality benefit for regional anesthesia in this setting.},

@article{nevo2010,
	Abstract = {Without a doubt, there has been a ``credibility
		  revolution'' in applied econometrics. One contributing
		  development has been in the improvement and increased use
		  in data analysis of ``structural methods''; that is, the
		  use of models based in economic theory. Structural modeling
		  attempts to use data to identify the parameters of an
		  underlying economic model, based on models of individual
		  choice or aggregate relations derived from them. Structural
		  estimation has a long tradition in economics, but better
		  and larger data sets, more powerful computers, improved
		  modeling methods, faster computational techniques, and new
		  econometric methods such as those mentioned above have
		  allowed researchers to make significant improvements. While
		  Angrist and Pischke extol the successes of empirical work
		  that estimates ``treatment effects'' based on actual or
		  quasi-experiments, they are much less sanguine about
		  structural analysis and hold industrial organization up as
		  an example where ``progress is less dramatic},

	Abstract = {Modern campaigns develop databases of detailed information
		  about citizens to inform electoral strategy and to guide
		  tactical efforts. Despite sensational reports about the
		  value of individual consumer data, the most valuable
		  information campaigns acquire comes from the behaviors and
		  direct responses provided by citizens themselves. Campaign
		  data analysts develop models using this information to
		  produce individual-level predictions about citizens'
		  likelihoods of performing certain political behaviors, of
		  supporting candidates and issues, and of changing their
		  support conditional on being targeted with specific
		  campaign interventions. The use of these predictive scores
		  has increased dramatically since 2004, and their use could
		  yield sizable gains to campaigns that harness them. At the
		  same time, their widespread use effectively creates a
		  coordination game with incomplete information between
		  allied organizations. As such, organizations would benefit
		  from partitioning the electorate to not duplicate efforts,
		  but legal and political constraints preclude that
		  possibility.},

		  heavily raided during the slave trade are less trusting
		  today. Evidence from a variety of identification strategies
		  suggests that the relationship is causal. Examining causal
		  mecha- nisms, we show that most of the impact of the slave
		  trade is through factors that are internal to the

	Abstract = {This article presents an experiment in which 49 Indonesian
		  villages were randomly assigned to choose development
		  projects through either representative-based meetings or
		  direct election-based plebiscites. Plebiscites resulted in
		  dramatically higher satisfaction among villagers, increased
		  knowledge about the project, greater perceived benefits,
		  and higher reported willingness to contribute. Changing the
		  political mechanism had much smaller effects on the actual
		  projects selected, with some evidence that plebiscites
		  resulted in projects chosen by women being located in
		  poorer areas. The results suggest that direct participation
		  in political decision making can substantially increase
		  satisfaction and legitimacy.},

	Abstract = {This article examines the significance of the Legislation
		  Law (lifa fa), passed by the National People's Congress
		  (NPC) in March 2000. The Legislation Law represents an
		  attempt by the NPC to rationalize China's legal system,
		  establish a uniform legislative hierarchy and consolidate
		  its authority over other important lawmaking institutions.
		  The politics behind the Law's development therefore offer
		  insight into the balance of power in China's lawmaking
		  arena, revealing how key institutions -- the NPC, the State
		  Council and local people's congresses -- engaged in
		  bureaucratic bargaining over fundamental questions of their
		  existence and authority within an evolving system. While
		  the promulgated Law reveals the mixed results of this
		  complex process, it also makes possible a more open and
		  consultative legislative process by sanctioning the
		  emergence of public legislative hearings. Now gaining
		  currency around China, hearings are a new development and
		  could be an important step in institutionalizing more
		  meaningful citizen participation in the legislative
		  process.},

	Abstract = {It is widely believed that rents from windfall revenue
		  undermine accountability. An enduring explana- tion is that
		  windfalls free leaders from the need to tax, producing a
		  quiescent population. Yet, there is little direct evidence
		  of how windfalls and taxes affect citizen political action.
		  I use novel revenue and information experiments to examine
		  whether and why windfalls (compared to taxes) affect how
		  citizens participate in politics. The experiments were
		  embedded in a public awareness campaign conducted with
		  1,863 citizens in Indonesia. The results---from an original
		  survey and postcard campaign---indicate that the tax
		  treatment increased monitoring and anti-incumbent political
		  action. Yet, when given spending information, citizens in
		  the windfall treatment cared just as much about misused
		  revenue as those in the tax treatment. The findings have
		  important implications for understanding not only how
		  revenue affects citizen political behavior but also how
		  people acquire and process information on government
		  spending},

	Abstract = {(from the chapter) It is more common to associate mass
		  media with conflict than with social, political, or
		  economic reconstruction. Ready at hand are examples of
		  Holocaust propaganda, negative media portrayals of
		  minorities during war and genocide in Bosnia, Serbia, and
		  Rwanda, and ethnic propaganda via SMS and blogging in Kenya
		  during its election violence. Media that incite conflict
		  are not only attention-grabbing, they seem to work. For
		  example, a recent analysis of Rwandan hate radio leading up
		  to and during the genocide pins at least 9 percent, or
		  45,000 deaths, on hate radio broadcasts. However, media are
		  also used for building peaceful social relations and for
		  reconstructing communities economically and politically.
		  Psychologists, who have studied how media can promote
		  stereotyping, prejudice, and conflict, also study how media
		  help to reconstruct communities. The social-psychological
		  mechanisms supposed to underlie media aimed at
		  reconstruction are in many cases similar to those thought
		  to underlie conflict media. These mechanisms include
		  individual cognitive, emotional, and motivational responses
		  to media, in addition to facets of interpersonal
		  communication and social influence sparked by media. This
		  chapter takes the position that the design of media
		  interventions should be informed by these psychological
		  theories, and that psychologists can expand on their
		  theories through the study of real-world media
		  interventions. I begin by reviewing the types of media

		  stories portrayed by news media, films, theater, and in
		  radio or television dramas. After reviewing examples of
		  media interventions that use public narratives to rebuild
		  communities, I review the social-psychological theories
		  that seek to explain media influence. I then describe two
		  studies of post-conflict media interventions that tested

@article{pearl2009,
	Abstract = {This reviewpresents empirical researcherswith recent
		  advances in causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic
		  shifts that must be un- dertaken in moving fromtraditional
		  statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate
		  data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that
		  un- derly all causal inferences, the languages used in
		  formulating those assump- tions, the conditional nature of
		  all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that
		  have been developed for the assessment of such claims.
		  These advances are illustrated using a general theory of
		  causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM)
		  described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies
		  other approaches to causation, and provides a coher-
		  entmathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and
		  counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the
		  development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a
		  combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types
		  of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of
		  potential interven- tions, (also called ``causal
		  effects'' or ``policy evaluation'') (2) queries about
		  probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of
		  ``regret,'' ``attri- bution'' or ``causes of
		  effects'') and (3) queries about direct and indirect
		  effects (also known as ``mediation''). Finally, the paper
		  defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the
		  structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents
		  tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong
		  features of both.},

	Abstract = {Community food security (CFS) is an incipient movement
		  based on the re-localization of many food system activities
		  in response to values concerning the social, health,
		  economic, and environmental consequences of the globalizing
		  food system. This study examines the salience of these
		  values based on the action agendas and accomplishments
		  emerging from community planning events in six rural
		  counties of New York, and the nature and type of
		  participation and local support. The study finds a high
		  level of agreement between CFS values as articulated by
		  national leaders in this incipient movement and the action
		  agendas. Further evidence of the salience of these themes
		  is seen in the levels and types of activities and
		  accomplishments taking place 8--12 months after the
		  planning events. However, these follow-through activities
		  appear to have been impeded by a variety of government
		  regulations, uneven levels of support from community
		  organizations and agencies, and a policy environment of
		  fiscal austerity, narrow outcome-oriented accountability,
		  and allocation of agency staff toward special-purpose
		  grants and contracts. Many of these constraints are likely
		  to exist in other communities and are beyond the scope of
		  what community volunteers and practitioners can be expected
		  to address on their own.},

@article{perlman1999ent,
	Abstract = {In the past two decades, striking examples of allegedly
		  inferior likelihood ratio tests (LRT) have appeared in the
		  statistical literature. These examples, which arise in
		  multiparameter hypothesis testing problems, have several
		  common features. In each case the null hypothesis is
		  composite, the size α LRT is not similar and hence biased,
		  and competing size α tests can be constructed that are
		  less biased, or even unbiased, and that dominate the LRT in
		  the sense of being everywhere more powerful. It is
		  therefore asserted that in these examples and, by
		  implication, many other testing problems, the LR criterion
		  produces "inferior," "deficient," "undesirable," or
		  "flawed" statistical procedures. This message, which
		  appears to be proliferating, is wrong. In each example it
		  is the allegedly superior test that is flawed, not the LRT.
		  At worst, the "superior" tests provide unwarranted and
		  inappropriate inferences and have been deemed
		  scientifically unacceptable by applied statisticians. This
		  reinforces the well-documented but oft-neglected fact that
		  the Neyman-Pearson theory desideratum of a more (or most)
		  powerful size α test may be scientifically inappropriate;
		  the same is true for the criteria of unbiasedness and
		  α-admissibility. Although the LR criterion is not
		  infallible, we believe that it remains a generally
		  reasonable first option for non-Bayesian parametric
		  hypothesis-testing problems.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigates geographic variation in
		  chemotherapy utilization for ovarian cancer in both
		  absolute and relative terms and examines area
		  characteristics associated with this variation. DATA
		  SOURCES: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
		  Medicare data from 1990 to 2001 for Medicare patients over
		  65 with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer between 1990 and
		  1999. Chemotherapy within a year of diagnosis was
		  identified by Medicare billing codes. The hospital referral
		  region (HRR) represents the geographic unit of analysis.
		  STUDY DESIGN: A logit model predicting the probability of
		  receiving chemotherapy by each of the 39 HRRs. Control
		  variables included medical characteristics (patient age,
		  stage, year of diagnosis, and comorbidities) and
		  socioeconomic characteristics (race, income, and
		  education). The variation among HRRs was tested by the chi2
		  statistic, and the relative contribution was measured by
		  the omega statistic. HHR market characteristic are then
		  used to explain HRR-level variation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
		  The average chemotherapy rate was 56.6 percent, with a
		  range by HRR from 33 percent to 67 percent. There were
		  large and significant differences in chemotherapy use
		  between HRRs, reflected by a chi2 for HRR of 146 (df = 38,
		  p < .001). HRR-level variation in chemotherapy use can be
		  partially explained by higher chemotherapy rates in HRRs
		  with a higher percentage of hospitals with oncology
		  services. However, an omega analysis indicates that, by
		  about 15 to one, the variation between patients in use of
		  chemotherapy reflects variations in patient characteristics
		  rather than unexplained variation among HRRs. CONCLUSIONS:
		  While absolute levels of chemotherapy variation between
		  geographic areas are large and statistically significant,
		  this analysis suggests that the role of geography in
		  determining who gets chemotherapy is small relative to
		  individual medical characteristics. Nevertheless, while
		  variation by medical characteristics can be medically
		  justified, the same cannot be said for geographic
		  variation. Our finding that density of oncology hospitals
		  predicts chemotherapy use suggests that provider supply is
		  positively correlated with geographic variation.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores the conditions under which cultural
		  cleavages become politically salient. It does so by taking
		  advantage of the natural experiment afforded by the
		  division of the Chewa and Tumbuka peoples by the border
		  between Zambia and Malawi. I document that, while the
		  objective cultural differences between Chewas and Tumbukas
		  on both sides of the border are identical, the political
		  salience of the division between these communities is
		  altogether different. I argue that this difference stems
		  from the different sizes of the Chewa and Tumbuka
		  communities in each country relative to each country's
		  national political arena. In Malawi, Chewas and Tumbukas
		  are each large groups vis-\`{a}-vis the country as a whole
		  and, thus, serve as viable bases for political
		  coalition-building. In Zambia, Chewas and Tumbukas are
		  small relative to the country as a whole and, thus, not
		  useful to mobilize as bases of political support. The
		  analysis suggests that the political salience of a cultural
		  cleavage depends not on the nature of the cleavage itself
		  (since it is identical in both countries) but on the sizes
		  of the groups it defines and whether or not they will be
		  useful vehicles for political competition.},

	Abstract = {In most studies of the impact of ethnic diversity on
		  economic growth, diversity is hypothesized to affect growth
		  through its effect on macroeconomic policies. This article
		  shows that most measures of ethnic diversity (including the
		  commonly used \{ELF\} measure) are inappropriate for
		  testing this hypothesis. This is because they are
		  constructed from enumerations of ethnic groups that include
		  all of the ethnographically distinct groups in a country
		  irrespective of whether or not they engage in the political
		  competition whose effects on macroeconomic policymaking are
		  being tested. I present a new index of ethnic
		  fractionalization based on an accounting of politically
		  relevant ethnic groups in 42 African countries. I employ
		  this measure (called \{PREG\}, for Politically Relevant

	Abstract = {In most studies of the impact of ethnic diversity on
		  economic growth, diversity is hypothesized to affect growth
		  through its effect on macroeconomic policies. This article
		  shows that most measures of ethnic diversity (including the
		  commonly used \{ELF\} measure) are inappropriate for
		  testing this hypothesis. This is because they are
		  constructed from enumerations of ethnic groups that include
		  all of the ethnographically distinct groups in a country
		  irrespective of whether or not they engage in the political
		  competition whose effects on macroeconomic policymaking are
		  being tested. I present a new index of ethnic
		  fractionalization based on an accounting of politically
		  relevant ethnic groups in 42 African countries. I employ
		  this measure (called \{PREG\}, for Politically Relevant
		  Ethnic Groups) to replicate Easterly and Levine's
		  influential article on Africa's ``growth tragedy.'' I find
		  that \{PREG\} does a much better job of accounting for the
		  policy-mediated effects of ethnic diversity on economic

		  reports that getting married is the equivalent of
		  quadrupling your income and attending a club meeting
		  regularly is the equivalent of doubling your income. The
		  loss of social capital is felt in critical ways:
		  Communities with less social capital have lower educational
		  performance and more teen pregnancy, child suicide, low
		  birth weight, and prenatal mortality. Social capital is
		  also a strong predictor of crime rates and other measures
		  of neighborhood quality of life, as it is of our health: In
		  quantitative terms, if you both smoke and belong to no
		  groups, it's a close call as to which is the riskier

@article{rahman2004,
	Abstract = {In revisiting the influential Dyson and Moore (1983)
		  hypothesis as to why women in South India enjoy relatively
		  more agency than in the North, we conducted an econometric
		  analysis of the determinants of women's mobility and
		  decisionmaking authority. Data for the study come from a
		  household data survey carried out in the Northern state of
		  Uttar Pradesh and in the Southern state of Karnataka in
		  1995. We find that cross-cousin and uncle-niece marriage is
		  more prevalent in Karnataka as expected. Contrary to Dyson
		  and Moore, however, by 1995 a majority of communities in
		  both North and South practiced village exogamy, and dowries
		  in the two regions were of similar size. Reduced-form,
		  multivariate regressions show that cultural factors affect
		  women's autonomy in ways not earlier predicted. The impact
		  of village exogamy is mixed rather than negative, while
		  that of consanguinity is strongly negative rather than
		  positive as Dyson and Moore surmised. These authors
		  correctly identified the negative effect purdah has on
		  female mobility. Consistent with economic theory, our data
		  show that higher wages for women consistently improve their
		  mobility and authority, while higher male wages decrease
		  them. Improvements in infrastructure--particularly the
		  presence of street lights and schools in the village--are
		  associated with increased women's agency. We conclude,
		  therefore, that economic factors, state action, and
		  restrictions on mobility seem more powerful than kinship
		  structures as explanations of differences in female
		  autonomy between North and South India. CR - Copyright

	Abstract = {Dowries in South Asia have steadily risen over the last 40
		  years and now often amount to over 50 percent of a
		  household's assets. This paper attempts to investigate the
		  reasons behind this increase. It adapts Rosen's implicit
		  market model to the Indian marriage market and tests
		  predictions from the model with data from six villages in
		  South Central India and from the Indian census. It is found
		  that a "marriage squeeze" caused by population growth,
		  resulting in larger younger cohorts and hence a surplus of
		  women in the marriage market, has played a significant role
		  in the rise in dowries. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 1993 The

		  study the determinants of wife abuse in a community of

		  demonstrates that wife abuse is more likely when dowries

		  and when the cause of the abuse is perceived as
		  'legitimate' by the community. Hypotheses generated from
		  the qualitative work are tested with survey data, which
		  confirm that the risk of wife abuse significantly increases
		  with smaller dowry payments and alcohol consumption.
		  Furthermore, the statistical analysis reveals that women

		  inte- grating qualitative and quantitative approaches in
		  development research and program evaluation can help yield
		  insights that neither approach would produce on its own. In
		  assessing the impact of development programs and policies,
		  it is important to recognize that the quantitative methods
		  emphasized in this tool kit, while enormously useful,
		  nonetheless have some important limitations and that some
		  of these can be overcome by incorporating comple- mentary
		  qualitative approaches. An examination of the strengths and
		  weakness of orthodox stand-alone quantitative (and qualita-
		  tive) approaches is followed by a basic framework for
		  integrating different approaches, based on distinguishing
		  between data and the methods used to collect them. Some
		  practical examples of "mixed- method" approaches to program
		  evaluation are then given, and some conclusions drawn.},

@article{rao2008,
	Abstract = {Most economists think of common property as physical -- a
		  body of water, a forest -- and as $\backslash$nbounded
		  within geographic space. In this paper, building on work in
		  social theory, I argue that $\backslash$ncommon property
		  can also be social -- defined within symbolic space. People
		  can be bound by $\backslash$nwell-defined symbolic
		  agglomerations that have characteristics similar to common
		  property. I $\backslash$ncall these ``symbolic public
		  goods'' (SPGs) and make the case that such constructs are
		  central to $\backslash$nunderstanding collective action.
		  The point is illustrated by contrasting how conceptions of
		  $\backslash$nnationalism in Indonesia and India created
		  SPGs that resulted in very different strategies of local
		  $\backslash$ndevelopment. Indonesia emphasized collective
		  action by the poor that resulted in a form of
		  $\backslash$nregressive taxation, enforced by the ideology
		  of svadaya gotong royong (community self-help)
		  $\backslash$nthat was both internalized and coercively
		  enforced. India emphasized democratic decentralization
		  $\backslash$nvia the panchayat system driven by the
		  Gandhian ideology of gram swaraj (self-reliant villages).
		  $\backslash$nThis has resulted in an unusual
		  equity-efficiency tradeoff; Indonesia has delivered public
		  services $\backslash$nmore efficiently than India, but at
		  the cost of democratic freedoms and voice. I argue that the
		  $\backslash$nchallenge for these countries is to not
		  undermine their existing SPGs but to build on them;
		  $\backslash$nIndonesia should retain the spirit of svadaya
		  gotong royong but to channel it in an equitable and
		  $\backslash$ndemocratic direction, while India should build
		  the capacity of the panchayat system by giving it
		  $\backslash$nfiscal teeth, while promoting underutilized
		  institutions such as Gram Sabhas that encourage
		  $\backslash$naccountability and transparency.},

		  statistics in constructing conditional distributions for
		  inference about a parameter. Special emphasis is given to
		  recent developments in accurate approximation of densities,
		  distribution functions and likelihood functions, and to the
		  role of conditioning in these approximations. Exact
		  conditional or marginal inference is available for
		  essentially two classes of models, exponential family
		  models and transformation family models. The approximations
		  are very useful for practical implementation of these exact
		  results. The form of the approximations suggests methods
		  for inference in more general families.},

	Abstract = {{Youth music is the most creative and contested location
		  on the cultural landscape. It is a vehicle for generational
		  moods and aspirations, a public refuge for fantasies
		  outlawed in daily life, a testing ground for technical
		  ingenuity, an enormously profitable commercial channel for
		  mainstream narratives of thought and behavior, and one of
		  the corporate state's main theatres for national moral
		  panic. Today's sounds, and the debates about their various
		  forms, are inseparable from the social conditions of the
		  last two decades: class polarization, racial
		  marginalization, and economic violence enacted to a degree
		  that has left youth, as a whole, with drastically reduced
		  opportunities in life. Youth culture is still responding to
		  these uneven developments with a passion that has been
		  romanticized by some critics as a significant form of
		  resistance, and denigrated by others as an avoidance of
		  direct and political
		  protest.<br><br><b></b><b><i>Microphone
		  Fiends</i></b><b></b>, a collection of original essays and
		  interviews, brings together some of the best known
		  scholars, critics, journalists and performers to focus on
		  the contemporary scene. It includes theoretical discussions
		  of musical history along with social commentaries about
		  genres like disco, metal and rap music, and case histories
		  of specific movements like the Riot Grrls, funk clubbing in
		  Rio de Janeiro, and the British rave scene. The contents of
		  the volume engage with the broad tradition of cultural
		  studies and sociology of youth music and culture, but they
		  are also designed to address audiences reached by
		  mainstream music journalism and fans of any musical
		  taste.}},

		  This is done in two steps. First, a test is developed to
		  detect a coherent association. The test is a generalization
		  of the tests of Mann and Whitney, Wilcoxon, and Gehan.
		  Second, the sensitivity of the test to hidden bias is

		  assignments is unknown, and therefore randomization tests
		  are not generally applicable. However, permutation tests
		  that condition on sample information about the treatment
		  assignment mechanism can be applicable in observational
		  studies, provided treatment assignment is strongly
		  ignorable. These tests use the conditional distribution of
		  the treatment assignments given a sufficient statistic for

		  difference leads to the same inferences as the conditional

		  level, and two approximations are discussed. A clinical

	Abstract = {Direct adjustment or standardization applies population
		  weights to subclass means in an effort to estimate
		  population quantities from a sample that is not
		  representative of the population. Direct adjustment has
		  several attractive features, but when there are many
		  subclasses it can attach large weights to small quantities
		  of data, often in a fairly erratic manner. In the extreme,
		  direct adjustment can attach infinite weight to nonexistent
		  data, a noticeable inconvenience in practice. This article
		  proposes a method of model-based direct adjustment that
		  preserves the attractive features of conventional direct
		  adjustment while stabilizing the weights attached to small
		  subclasses. The sample mean and conventional direct
		  adjustment are both special cases of model-based direct
		  adjustment under two different extreme models for the
		  subclass-specific selection probabilities. The discussion
		  of this method provides some insights into the behavior of
		  true and estimated propensity scores: the estimated scores
		  are better than the true ones for almost the same reason
		  that direct adjustment can outperform the sample mean in a
		  simple random sample. The method is applied to a nonrandom

		  criterion is widely discussed in textbooks and is often

		  suitable analysis using the data at hand. Moreover, a study
		  without a dose-response relationship may or may not be less

	Abstract = {In 1994 the School of Medicine of Queen's University in
		  Kingston, Ontario, its clinical teachers, and the three
		  principal teaching hospitals initiated a new approach to
		  funding, the Alternative Funding Plan, a pragmatic response
		  to the inability of fee-for-service billing by clinical
		  faculty to subsidize the academic mission of the health
		  sciences center. The center was funded to provide a package
		  of service and academic deliverables (outputs), rather than
		  on the basis of payment for physician clinical activity
		  (inputs). The new plan required a new governance structure
		  representing stakeholders and raised a number of important
		  issues: how to reconcile the preservation of physician
		  professional autonomy with corporate responsibilities; how
		  to gather requisite information so as to equitably allocate
		  resources; and how to report to the Ontario Ministry of
		  Health and Long-term Care in order to demonstrate
		  accountability. In subsequent iterations of the agreement
		  it was necessary to address issues of flexibility resulting
		  from locked-in funding levels and to devise meaningful
		  performance measures for departments and the center as a
		  whole. The authors conclude that the Alternative Funding
		  Plan represents a successful innovation in funding for an
		  academic health sciences center in that it has created
		  financial stability, as well as modest positive effects for
		  education and research. The Ontario government hopes to
		  replicate the model at the province's other four health

	Abstract = {In an effort to determine whether a particular treatment
		  causes a particular outcome event, data are obtained from a
		  database system that records events when they occur, and
		  for such events, the system records exposure to the
		  treatment. That is, the system records information about
		  cases. The system provides no information about events that
		  might have occurred but did not, that is, about units which
		  are not cases. Roughly speaking, we know the number of
		  successes for two proportions, treated and control, but not
		  the numbers of trials or units for these proportions;
		  indeed, the concept of a "trial" may be somewhat vague.
		  With no further information, the situation is quite
		  hopeless. However, an interesting strategy that is
		  sometimes used entails identifying two types of cases whose
		  origin is entirely different so that it is known the cases
		  of the second type were definitely not affected by the
		  treatment under study. This strategy--the case-case or
		  case2-study--seems to have been reinvented independently
		  many times, and has recently been offered as a general
		  strategy for infectious disease epidemiology by McCarthy
		  and Giesecke (1999, International Journal of Epidemiology
		  28, 764-768). Can this strategy permit estimation of the
		  number of cases caused by the treatment? Using attributable
		  effects in a new way, a method of exact inference is
		  proposed, along with a large sample approximation. Two
		  examples are discussed: one concerning the effects of
		  daytime running lights (DRLs) on the risk of multivehicle
		  accidents; the other concerning the origin of a Salmonella
		  infection. A counterexample with superficially similar
		  appearance is also discussed concerning suicide rates
		  following the publication of Final Exit; here, the
		  treatment may alter the outcome, or it may alter the type,
		  and the attributable effect cannot be estimated.},

	Abstract = {Huber's m-estimates use an estimating equation in which
		  observations are permitted a controlled level of influence.
		  The family of m-estimates includes least squares and
		  maximum likelihood, but typical applications give extreme
		  observations limited weight. Maritz proposed methods of
		  exact and approximate permutation inference for m-tests,
		  confidence intervals, and estimators, which can be derived
		  from random assignment of paired subjects to treatment or
		  control. In contrast, in observational studies, where
		  treatments are not randomly assigned, subjects matched for
		  observed covariates may differ in terms of unobserved
		  covariates, so differing outcomes may not be treatment
		  effects. In observational studies, a method of sensitivity
		  analysis is developed for m-tests, m-intervals, and
		  m-estimates: it shows the extent to which inferences would
		  be altered by biases of various magnitudes due to nonrandom
		  treatment assignment. The method is developed for both
		  matched pairs, with one treated subject matched to one
		  control, and for matched sets, with one treated subject
		  matched to one or more controls. The method is illustrated
		  using two studies: (i) a paired study of damage to DNA from
		  exposure to chromium and nickel and (ii) a study with one
		  or two matched controls comparing side effects of two drug
		  regimes to treat tuberculosis. The approach yields
		  sensitivity analyses for: (i) m-tests with Huber's weight
		  function and other robust weight functions, (ii) the
		  permutational t-test which uses the observations directly,
		  and (iii) various other procedures such as the sign test,
		  Noether's test, and the permutation distribution of the

		  question is whether one of the treatments tends
		  to$\backslash$ncause such aberrant responses, quite apart
		  from any other beneficial$\backslash$nor harmful effects
		  that treatment may have. Common practice is
		  to$\backslash$nreduce aberrant responses to binary events
		  and apply Fisher's exact$\backslash$ntest for a 2 x 2
		  table, but this approach discards the
		  available$\backslash$ninformation about the magnitude of
		  the aberration. We propose a new$\backslash$nrandomization
		  test for this problem that uses information about
		  both$\backslash$nthe number of aberrations and their
		  magnitude. In extreme situations,$\backslash$nthe new test
		  reduces to either Fisher's exact test or
		  Wilcoxon's$\backslash$nrank sum test, but in common
		  situations, the new test has features$\backslash$nof both
		  methods. Importantly, this exact test reacts only to
		  aberrant$\backslash$neffects; it is completely unaffected
		  by treatment effects that do$\backslash$nnot produce
		  aberrations. When aberrant responses have several
		  aspects,$\backslash$nwe examine the consequences of
		  selecting, after the fact, the one$\backslash$naspect
		  exhibiting the greatest aberration, and applying the
		  test$\backslash$nto that aspect. For a single response
		  variable, a confidence interval$\backslash$nis proposed for
		  an additive aberrant effect; the interval is
		  constructed$\backslash$nby inverting the test, and a
		  multivariate extension is briefly mentioned.$\backslash$nWe
		  illustrate the use of the test in the ACE-Inhibitor After
		  Anthracycline$\backslash$n(AAA) randomized trial, which was
		  aimed at preserving cardiac function$\backslash$nin
		  children treated for cancer. Seven of 135 children were
		  removed$\backslash$nfrom the trial due to substantial
		  cardiac declines; 6 of these were$\backslash$non placebo, I of whom subsequently died.},

@article{rosenbaum2011,
	Abstract = {Summary In an observational or nonrandomized study of
		  treatment effects, a sensitivity analysis indicates the
		  magnitude of bias from unmeasured covariates that would
		  need to be present to alter the conclusions of a na\"{\i}ve
		  analysis that presumes adjustments for observed covariates
		  suffice to remove all bias. The power of sensitivity
		  analysis is the probability that it will reject a false
		  hypothesis about treatment effects allowing for a departure
		  from random assignment of a specified magnitude; in
		  particular, if this specified magnitude is "no departure"
		  then this is the same as the power of a randomization test
		  in a randomized experiment. A new family of u-statistics is
		  proposed that includes Wilcoxon's signed rank statistic but
		  also includes other statistics with substantially higher
		  power when a sensitivity analysis is performed in an
		  observational study. Wilcoxon's statistic has high power to
		  detect small effects in large randomized experiments-that
		  is, it often has good Pitman efficiency-but small effects
		  are invariably sensitive to small unobserved biases.
		  Members of this family of u-statistics that emphasize
		  medium to large effects can have substantially higher power
		  in a sensitivity analysis. For example, in one situation
		  with 250 pair differences that are Normal with expectation
		  1/2 and variance 1, the power of a sensitivity analysis
		  that uses Wilcoxon's statistic is 0.08 while the power of
		  another member of the family of u-statistics is 0.66. The
		  topic is examined by performing a sensitivity analysis in
		  three observational studies, using an asymptotic measure
		  called the design sensitivity, and by simulating power in
		  finite samples. The three examples are drawn from
		  epidemiology, clinical medicine, and genetic toxicology.},

	Abstract = {In an observational study, one treated subject may be
		  matched for observed covariates to either one or several
		  untreated controls. The common motivation for using several
		  controls rather than one is to increase the power of a test
		  of no effect under the doubtful assumption that matching
		  for observed covariates suffices to remove bias from
		  nonrandom treatment assignment. Does the choice between one
		  or several matched controls affect the sensitivity of
		  conclusions to violations of this doubtful assumption? With
		  continuous responses, it is known that reducing the
		  heterogeneity of matched pair differences reduces
		  sensitivity to unmeasured biases, but increasing the sample
		  size has a highly circumscribed effect on sensitivity to
		  bias. Is the use of several controls rather than one
		  analogous to a reduction in heterogeneity or to an increase
		  in sample size? The issue is examined for Huber's
		  m-statistics, including the t-test, the examination having
		  three components: an example, asymptotic calculations using
		  design sensitivity, and a simulation. Use of multiple
		  controls with continuous responses yields a nontrivial
		  reduction in sensitivity to unmeasured biases. An example
		  looks at lead and cadmium in the blood of smokers from the
		  2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A
		  by-product of the discussion is a new result giving the

	Abstract = {An effect is attributable to treatment if it would not
		  have been observed had the individual been exposed to
		  control instead. Extending earlier results on attributable
		  effects in unmatched groups, a method of exact
		  randomization inference and sensitivity analysis is
		  developed for case-referent, case-crossover, and cohort
		  studies with matched sets, and a large sample approximation
		  to the exact inference is given. The unmatched case,
		  considered previously, has certain symmetries that the
		  matched case, considered here, does not have. As a result,
		  approximation for the matched case requires the use of the
		  recently developed method of asymptotic separability, which
		  was riot needed in the unmatched case. Several examples are
		  presented, including a case-referent study of Helicobacter
		  pylori infection as a cause of myocardial infarction, a
		  case-crossover study of alcohol as a cause of injury, a
		  cohort study of women who gave birth at home, and a study
		  of the effects of cadmium exposure with a continuous
		  outcome measuring kidney function. Unlike tests of no
		  effect, inference about attributable effects has a
		  different form in case-referent and cohort studies.},

		  withheld, yielding a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with three
		  degrees of freedom between groups. The differential effect
		  of the two treatments is the effect of applying one
		  treatment in lieu of the other. In randomised experiments,
		  the differential effect is of no more or less interest than
		  other treatment contrasts. Differential effects play a
		  special role in certain observational studies in which
		  treatments are not assigned to subjects at random, where
		  differing outcomes may reflect biased assignments rather
		  than effects caused by the treatments. Differential effects
		  are immune to certain types of unobserved bias, called
		  generic biases, which are associated with both treatments
		  in a similar way. This is explored using several examples
		  and models. Differential effects are not immune to
		  differential biases, whose possible consequences are
		  examined by sensitivity analysis.},

	Abstract = {There are two treatments, each of which may be applied or
		  withheld, yielding a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with three
		  degrees of freedom between groups. The differential effect
		  of the two treatments is the effect of applying one
		  treatment in lieu of the other. In randomised experiments,
		  the differential effect is of no more or less interest than
		  other treatment contrasts. Differential effects play a
		  special role in certain observational studies in which
		  treatments are not assigned to subjects at random, where
		  differing outcomes may reflect biased assignments rather
		  than effects caused by the treatments. Differential effects
		  are immune to certain types of unobserved bias, called
		  generic biases, which are associated with both treatments
		  in a similar way. This is explored using several examples
		  and models. Differential effects are not immune to
		  differential biases, whose possible consequences are
		  examined by sensitivity analysis.},

		  generate more durable and stable cooperative international
		  regimes and are easier to achieve ex ante. The escape
		  clause is endogenous in a model of repeated trade-barrier
		  setting in the presence of symmetric, two-sided, political
		  uncertainty. They permit, along the equilibrium path,
		  countries to temporarily deviate from their obligations in
		  periods of excessive, unexpected political pressure at some
		  prenegotiated cost. The architects of international
		  agreements optimally choose a cost so that escape clauses
		  are neither too cheap to use (encouraging frequent
		  recourse, effectively reducing the benefits of cooperation)
		  nor too expensive (making their use rare and increasing the
		  chance of systemic breakdown). The international
		  institution's crucial role is to provide information,
		  verifying that the self-enforcing penalty has been paid
		  (voluntarily), rather than to coerce payment. Escape
		  clauses also make agreements easier to reach initially.
		  Their flexibility reassures states that the division of the
		  long-term gains from the agreement is not immutable.},

	Abstract = {Matched sampling is often used to help assess the causal
		  effect of some exposure or intervention, typically when
		  randomized experiments are not available or cannot be
		  conducted. This book presents a selection of Donald B.
		  Rubin's research articles on matched sampling, from the
		  early 1970s, when the author was one of the major
		  researchers involved in establishing the field, to recent
		  contributions to this now extremely active area. The
		  articles include fundamental theoretical studies that have
		  become classics, important extensions, and real
		  applications that range from breast cancer treatments to
		  tobacco litigation to studies of criminal tendencies. They
		  are organized into seven parts, each with an introduction
		  by the author that provides historical and personal context
		  and discusses the relevance of the work today. A concluding
		  essay offers advice to investigators designing
		  observational studies. The book provides an accessible
		  introduction to the study of matched sampling and will be
		  an indispensable reference for students and researchers in
		  statistics, epidemiology, medicine, economics, education,
		  sociology, political science, and anyone else doing
		  empirical research to evaluate the causal effects of
		  interventions. },

		  Verba, Schlozman, and Brady's Civic Voluntarism Model. The
		  two approaches are outlined, and it is argued that they in
		  fact share several key characteristics and therefore, also
		  fall victim to some of the same fallacies. These
		  similarities include the focus on non-political
		  institutions as the determents of political activity and
		  the idea of resources or capital being part of the process
		  leading to participation. Both theories neglect the
		  importance of political institutions and state structure in
		  creating opportunities for and influencing the nature of
		  political participation. The example of study circles in
		  Sweden is examined in an attempt to link political
		  participation to political context.},

	Abstract = {Causal inference in an important topic and one that is now
		  attracting serious attention of statisticians. Although
		  there exist recent discussions concerning the general
		  definition of causal effects and a substantial literature
		  on specific techniques for the analysis of data in
		  randomized and nonrandomized studies, there has been
		  relatively little discussion of modes of statistical
		  inference for causal effects. This presentation briefly
		  describes and contrasts four basic modes of statistical
		  inference for causal effects, emphasizes the common
		  underlying causal framework with a posited assignment
		  mechanism, and describes practical implications in the
		  context of an example involving the effects of switching
		  from a name-brand to a generic drug. A fundamental
		  conclusion is that in such nonrandomized studies,
		  sensitivity of inference to the assignment mechanism is the
		  dominant issue, and it cannot be avoided by changing modes
		  of inference, for instance, by changing from
		  randomization-based to Bayesian methods.},

	Abstract = {We model corruption in a society as a result of bargaining
		  for bribes between private citizens and public officials.
		  We investigate the role that incomplete information with
		  respect to the intrinsic moral cost of one's potential
		  corruption partner plays out in his or her propensity to
		  engage in bribery, and, consequently, the equilibrium level
		  of corruption in the society. We assume that the cost of
		  engaging in corruption is subject to strategic
		  complementarities, which may lead to multiple corruption
		  equilibria. We find that corruption is lowest when
		  potential bribers and potential bribees are uncertain
		  regarding each other's " corruptibility" and have
		  asymmetric bargaining powers. Our uncertainty result
		  provides theoretical support in favor of anti-corruption
		  strategies, such as staff rotation in public offices, aimed
		  at decreasing the social closeness of bribers and bribees.
		  Our bargaining power result suggests that, under
		  uncertainty, monopolistic public good provision has the
		  same corruption-reducing effect as competitive public good
		  provision. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

		  contributions are outlined. More attention is given to the
		  technical concepts he introduced or emphasized, such as
		  consistency, sufficiency, efficiency, information, and
		  maximum likelihood. Still more attention is given to his
		  conception and concepts of probability and inference,
		  including likelihood, the fiducial argument, and hypothesis
		  testing. Fisher is at once very near to and very far from

	Abstract = {We describe a new computer program that combines
		  evolutionary algorithm methods with a derivative-based,
		  quasi-Newton method to solve difficult unconstrained
		  optimization problems. The program, called GENOUD (GENetic
		  Optimization Using Derivatives), effectively solves
		  problems that are nonlinear or perhaps even discontinuous
		  in the parameters of the function to be optimized. When a
		  statistical model's estimating function (for example, a
		  log-likelihood) is nonlinear in the model's parameters, the
		  function to be optimized will usually not be globally
		  concave and may contain irregularities such as saddlepoints
		  or discontinuous jumps. Optimization methods that rely on
		  derivatives of the objective function may be unable to find
		  any optimum at all. Or multiple local optima may exist, so
		  that there is no guarantee that a derivative-based method
		  will converge to the global optimum. We discuss the
		  theoretical basis for expecting GENOUD to have a high
		  probability of finding global optima. We conduct Monte
		  Carlo experiments using scalar Normal mixture densities to
		  illustrate this capability. We also use a system of four
		  simultaneous nonlinear equations that has many parameters
		  and multiple local optima to compare the performance of
		  GENOUD to that of the Gauss-Newton algorithm in SAS's PROC
		  MODEL.},

	Abstract = {In contrast to statistical methods, a number of case study
		  methods\&mdash;collectively referred to as Mill\&apos;s
		  methods, used by generations of social science
		  researchers\&mdash;only consider deterministic
		  relationships. They do so to their detriment because
		  heeding the basic lessons of statistical inference can
		  prevent serious inferential errors. Of particular
		  importance is the use of conditional probabilities to
		  compare relevant counterfactuals. A prominent example of
		  work using Mill\&apos;s methods is Theda Skocpol\&apos;s
		  States and Social Revolutions. Barbara Geddes\&apos;s
		  widely assigned critique of Skocpol\&apos;s claim of a
		  causal relationship between foreign threat and social
		  revolution is valid if this relationship is considered to
		  be deterministic. If, however, we interpret Skocpol\&apos;s
		  hypothesized causal relationship to be probabilistic,
		  Geddes\&apos;s data support Skocpol\&apos;s hypothesis. But
		  Skocpol, unlike Geddes, failed to provide the data
		  necessary to compare conditional probabilities. Also
		  problematic for Skocpol is the fact that when one makes
		  causal inferences, conditional probabilities are of
		  interest only insofar as they provide information about
		  relevant counterfactuals.Jasjeet S. Sekhon thanks Walter R.

		  able to accomplish something that citizens in fledgling

	Abstract = {In contrast to statistical methods, a number of case study
		  methods\&mdash;collectively referred to as Mill\&apos;s
		  methods, used by generations of social science
		  researchers\&mdash;only consider deterministic
		  relationships. They do so to their detriment because
		  heeding the basic lessons of statistical inference can
		  prevent serious inferential errors. Of particular
		  importance is the use of conditional probabilities to
		  compare relevant counterfactuals. A prominent example of
		  work using Mill\&apos;s methods is Theda Skocpol\&apos;s
		  States and Social Revolutions. Barbara Geddes\&apos;s
		  widely assigned critique of Skocpol\&apos;s claim of a
		  causal relationship between foreign threat and social
		  revolution is valid if this relationship is considered to
		  be deterministic. If, however, we interpret Skocpol\&apos;s
		  hypothesized causal relationship to be probabilistic,
		  Geddes\&apos;s data support Skocpol\&apos;s hypothesis. But
		  Skocpol, unlike Geddes, failed to provide the data
		  necessary to compare conditional probabilities. Also
		  problematic for Skocpol is the fact that when one makes
		  causal inferences, conditional probabilities are of
		  interest only insofar as they provide information about
		  relevant counterfactuals.Jasjeet S. Sekhon thanks Walter R.

		  procedure and to what extent trialists confuse experiments
		  with surveys. It will be maintained that a number of

		  concentrated among the relatively worse off urban
		  households, which from a national perspective represent the
		  middle classes, and find suggestive evidence that part of

	Abstract = {Human capital theory predicts that differences in wages
		  arise because of differences in human capital. The latter
		  can be accumulated in two ways: through experience and
		  education. Using matched firm-worker data for the Ghanaian
		  Manufacturing sector we first test whether changes in wages
		  over the life cycle reflect changes in performance,
		  following the methodology of Medoff and Abraham [Medoff,
		  J.L., \& Abraham, K.G. (1980). Experience, Performance, and
		  Earnings. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 95(4), 703-736;
		  Medoff, J.L., \& Abraham, K.G. (1981). Are Those Paid More
		  Really More Productive? The Case of Experience. Journal of
		  Human Resources, 16(2), 186-216]. We find that
		  wage-seniority profiles are independent of performance - a
		  result that holds when controlling for firm fixed effects.
		  Extending the analysis, we include a control for
		  on-the-job-training and find that it does not attenuate the
		  seniority profile, which is also at odds with human capital
		  theory. We do find however that firm characteristics play
		  an important role. Wage-seniority profiles are steeper in
		  large firms, but performance profiles are not, suggesting
		  that the results from Medoff and Abraham are specific to
		  large firms. We then assess the role of education. Our
		  results confirm that education is important for the
		  allocation to job levels. Using data on cognitive ability,
		  we also find that the effect of education on wages is at
		  least partially because it signals cognitive ability. We
		  also find evidence that the returns to education are not
		  related to performance, while the returns to cognitive
		  ability are. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{silber1997,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Institutional complication rates are often used
		  to assess hospital quality of care, particularly for
		  conditions and procedures where mortality rates are not
		  useful because deaths are rare. The objective of this study
		  was to assess the correlation among hospital quality
		  assessment rankings based on adjusted mortality,
		  complication and failure-to-rescue rates. DESIGN: This
		  study used a clinically detailed administrative data set to
		  compare severity and case-mix adjusted hospital outcome
		  rankings for three different measures of quality of care:
		  in-hospital death, complication and failure-to-rescue
		  (in-hospital death following a complication). SETTING AND
		  PATIENTS: Analysis of 74,647 patients who underwent general
		  surgical procedures included in the 1991 and 1992
		  MedisGroups National Comparative Data Base. MEASUREMENTS:
		  Adjusted outcomes of death, complication and failure to
		  rescue based on multivariable logistic regression models.
		  RESULTS: For 142 hospitals, the correlation between
		  hospital rankings based on the death rate and those ranked
		  by the complication rate was only 0.208 (P = 0.013). A
		  similarly low correlation was present between the
		  complication and failure rate rankings, r = -0.090 (P =
		  0.287). A higher correlation was observed between the death
		  and failure rate rankings, r = 0.90 (P < 0.001).
		  CONCLUSIONS: For general surgical procedures, hospital rank
		  using the complication rate is poorly correlated with
		  rankings using the death or failure rate. Complication
		  rates should be used with great caution and should not be
		  used in isolation when assessing hospital quality of
		  care.},

@article{silber2003,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand differences in length of stay for
		  asthma patients between New York State and Pennsylvania
		  across children's and general hospitals in order to better
		  guide policy. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: All pediatric
		  admissions for asthma in the states of Pennsylvania and New
		  York using claims data obtained from each state for the
		  years 1996-1998, n = 38,310. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective
		  cohort design to model length of stay (LOS), the
		  probability of prolonged stay, conditional length of stay
		  (CLOS or the LOS after stay is prolonged), and the
		  probability of readmission, controlling for patient
		  factors, state, location and hospital type. ANALYTIC
		  METHODS: Logit models were used to estimate the probability
		  of prolonged stay and readmission. The LOS and the CLOS
		  were estimated with Cox regression. Model variables
		  included comorbidities, income, race, distance from
		  hospital, and insurance type. Prolonged stay was based on a
		  Hollander-Proschan "New-Worse-Than-Used" test,
		  corresponding to a three-day stay. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The
		  LOS was longer in New York than Pennsylvania, and the
		  probabilities of prolonged stay and readmission were much
		  higher in New York than Pennsylvania. However, once an
		  admission was prolonged, there were no differences in CLOS
		  between states (when readmissions were not added to the LOS
		  calculation). In both states, children's hospitals and
		  general hospitals had similar adjusted LOS. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Management of asthma appears more efficient in Pennsylvania
		  than New York: Less severe patients are discharged faster
		  in Pennsylvania than New York; once discharged, patients
		  are less likely to be readmitted in Pennsylvania than New
		  York. However, once a stay is prolonged, there is little
		  difference between New York and Pennsylvania, suggesting
		  medical care for severely ill patients is similar across
		  states. Differences between children's and general
		  hospitals were small as compared to differences between
		  states. We conclude that policy initiatives in New York,
		  and other states, should focus their efforts on improving
		  the care provided to less severe patients in order to help
		  reduce overall length of stay.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: It is generally thought that the
		  use of preoperative antibiotics reduces the risk of
		  postoperative infection, yet few studies have described the
		  association between preoperative antibiotics and the risk
		  of dying. The objective of this study was to determine
		  whether preoperative antibiotics are associated with a
		  reduced risk of death. METHODS: We performed a multivariate
		  matched, population-based, case-control study of death
		  following surgery on 1362 Pennsylvania Medicare patients
		  between 65 and 85 years of age undergoing general and
		  orthopedic surgery. Cases (681 deaths within 60 days from
		  hospital admission) were randomly selected throughout
		  Pennsylvania using claims from 1995 and 1996. Models were
		  developed to scan Medicare claims, looking for controls who
		  did not die and who were the closest matches to the
		  previously selected cases based on preoperative
		  characteristics. Cases and their controls were identified,
		  and charts were abstracted to define antibiotic use and
		  obtain baseline severity adjustment data. RESULTS: For
		  general surgery, the odds of dying within 60 days were less
		  than half in those treated with preoperative antibiotics
		  within 2 hours of incision as compared with those without
		  such treatment: (odds ratio = 0.44; 95\% confidence
		  interval, 0.32-0.60), P < 0.0001). For orthopedic surgery,
		  no significant mortality reduction was observed (OR = 0.85;
		  95\% confidence interval, 0.54-1.32; P < 0.464).
		  INTERPRETATION: Preoperative antibiotics are associated
		  with a substantially lower 60-day mortality rate in elderly
		  patients undergoing general surgery. In patients who appear
		  to be comparable, the risk of death was half as large among
		  those who received preoperative antibiotics.},

		  Medicare population, yet no study has formally quantified
		  the change in prognosis that occurs after a broad range of
		  first complications. OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the
		  relative severity of 24 first postoperative complications.
		  RESEARCH DESIGN: We undertook a multivariate matched,
		  population-based, case-control study of death after surgery
		  in a sample of 1362 Pennsylvania Medicare patients.
		  SUBJECTS: Cases (681 deaths) were selected randomly using
		  claims from 1995-1996. Models were developed to scan all
		  Pennsylvania claims, looking for similar controls that did
		  not die. MEASURES: Charts were abstracted, complications
		  identified, and models were constructed to estimate the
		  odds of dying after any 1 of 24 first postoperative
		  complications. RESULTS: The odds of dying within 60 days
		  increased 3.4-fold (95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.5-4.7)
		  in patients with complications as compared with those
		  without complications. A first complication of respiratory
		  compromise was associated with a 7.2-fold increase in the
		  odds of dying (95\% CI 4.5-11.6). The first complications
		  of pneumonia or congestive heart failure were associated
		  with, respectively, 5-fold (95\% CI 2.1-12.1) and 5.1-fold
		  (2.3-11.1) increases in odds of dying as compared with no
		  complication. CONCLUSIONS: First complications after
		  surgery, even seemingly mild ones, may radically alter the
		  patient's risk of death. First complications often begin
		  the cascade of complications that end in death. Caregivers
		  should consider the first complication as a timely signal
		  of a changed clinical situation demanding a reevaluation of
		  the patient's care. Researchers may use these estimates to
		  determine the relative severity of a broad range of first

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Procedure times are important variables that
		  often are included in studies of quality and efficiency.
		  However, due to the need for costly chart review, most
		  studies are limited to single-institution analyses. In this
		  article, the authors describe how well the anesthesia claim
		  from Medicare can estimate chart times. METHODS: The
		  authors abstracted information on time of induction and
		  entrance to the recovery room ("anesthesia chart time")
		  from the charts of 1,931 patients who underwent general and
		  orthopedic surgical procedures in Pennsylvania. The authors
		  then merged the associated bills from claims data supplied
		  from Medicare (Part B data) that included a variable
		  denoting the time in minutes for the anesthesia service.
		  The authors also investigated the time from incision to
		  closure ("surgical chart time") on a subset of 1,888
		  patients. RESULTS: Anesthesia claim time from Medicare was
		  highly predictive of anesthesia chart time (Kendall's rank
		  correlation tau = 0.85, P < 0.0001, median absolute error =
		  5.1 min) but somewhat less predictive of surgical chart
		  time (Kendall's tau = 0.73, P < 0.0001, median absolute
		  error = 13.8 min). When predicting chart time from Medicare
		  bills, variables reflecting procedure type, comorbidities,
		  and hospital type did not significantly improve the
		  prediction, suggesting that errors in predicting the chart
		  time from the anesthesia bill time are not related to these
		  factors; however, the individual hospital did have some
		  influence on these estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesia chart
		  time can be well estimated using Medicare claims, thereby
		  facilitating studies with vastly larger sample sizes and
		  much lower costs of data collection.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is usually
		  administered by medical oncologists (MOs) or gynecologic
		  oncologists (GOs). GOs perform a broad spectrum of surgical
		  and medical activities while managing a limited number of
		  diseases; MOs specialize in the administration of
		  chemotherapy but manage a broad array of diseases. We asked
		  whether survival, treatment, and toxicity differed
		  according to the type of specialist providing the
		  chemotherapy after surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using
		  Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
		  (SEER)--Medicare data for patients 65 years old from 1991
		  through 2001 from eight SEER sites, we identified 344
		  patients with ovarian cancer who were treated with
		  chemotherapy by a GO after surgery. Using optimal matching
		  and propensity scores based on 36 characteristics, we
		  matched these patients to 344 similar patients who were
		  operated on and staged by the same type of surgeon but who
		  received chemotherapy from an MO. RESULTS: MOs administered
		  chemotherapy over more weeks than did the GOs (16.5 v 12.1
		  weeks, respectively; P < .0023), and MO patients had
		  substantially more weeks that included
		  chemotherapy-associated adverse events than GO patients
		  (16.2 v 8.9 weeks, respectively; P < .0001). However, there
		  was no difference in 5-year survival rate between the GO
		  and MO groups (35\% v 34\%, respectively; P = .45).
		  CONCLUSION: GO- and MO-treated patients who were closely
		  matched on prognostic characteristics experienced very
		  different rates of chemotherapy-associated adverse events
		  and very different chemotherapy treatment styles by
		  specialty type; however, their survival was virtually
		  identical.},

		  variable that is often analyzed when studying quality and
		  efficiency. Norms for procedure length have not been
		  reported from Medicare data sets, nor has the influence of
		  patient and hospital characteristics on procedure time been
		  estimated using Medicare data. METHODS: The authors
		  obtained Medicare claims on all patients aged 65-85 years

		  procedures in Pennsylvania. Anesthesia procedure time was
		  estimated from anesthesia time units bills supplied from
		  Medicare on 20 common general and orthopedic surgery

		  hospital and patient characteristics were developed.
		  RESULTS: Of the 77,638 patients, 31,472 had general surgery
		  and 46,166 underwent orthopedic procedures. The median
		  anesthesia time for general surgery was 133 min, and for
		  orthopedic surgery it was 146 min. After adjusting for

		  covariates associated with increased anesthesia time
		  included: multiple procedure on same day + 18.3 min (P <

		  share of their care at teaching-intensive hospitals.
		  DESIGN: A retrospective study of patient outcomes and

		  Thirty-day mortality, in-hospital complications, and

		  payment algorithms, as BMI is not collected in
		  administrative claims. METHODS: A total of 2045 severely or
		  morbidly obese patients (BMI >/= 35 kg/m, aged between 65
		  and 80 years) selected from 15,914 elderly patients in 47
		  hospitals undergoing hip and knee surgery, colectomy, and
		  thoracotomy were matched to 2 sets of 2045 nonobese
		  patients (BMI = 20-30 kg/m). A "limited match" controlled
		  for age, sex, race, procedure, and hospital. A "complete
		  match" also controlled for 30 additional factors such as
		  diabetes and admission clinical data from chart
		  abstraction. RESULTS: Mean BMI in the obese patients was 40
		  kg/m compared with 26 kg/m in the nonobese. In the complete
		  match, obese patients displayed increased odds of wound
		  infection: OR (odds ratio) = 1.64 (95\% CI: 1.21, 2.21);

		  (7\%, 12\%) greater in obese than in nonobese patients,
		  whereas Medicare payments increased only 3\% (2\%, 5\%).
		  Findings were similar in the limited match. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Obesity increases the risks and costs of surgery. Better
		  approaches are needed to reduce these risks. Furthermore,
		  to avoid incentives to underserve this population, Medicare
		  should consider incorporating incremental costs of caring
		  for obese patients into payment policy and include obesity

		  between 1991 to 2005 and 3 sets of 7375 matched white
		  control patients selected from 99,898 white potential
		  controls, using data for 16 US Surveillance, Epidemiology
		  and End Results (SEER) sites in the SEER-Medicare database.
		  All patients received follow-up through December 31, 2009,
		  and the black case patients were matched to 3 white control
		  populations on demographics (age, year of diagnosis, and
		  SEER site), presentation (demographics variables plus
		  patient comorbid conditions and tumor characteristics such
		  as stage, size, grade, and estrogen receptor status), and
		  treatment (presentation variables plus details of surgery,
		  radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND
		  MEASURES: 5-Year survival. RESULTS: The absolute difference
		  in 5-year survival (blacks, 55.9\%; whites, 68.8\%) was
		  12.9\% (95\% CI, 11.5\%-14.5\%;
		  P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001) in the demographics
		  match. This difference remained unchanged between 1991 and
		  2005. After matching on presentation characteristics, the
		  absolute difference in 5-year survival was 4.4\% (95\% CI,
		  2.8\%-5.8\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001) and was
		  3.6\% (95\% CI, 2.3\%-4.9\%;
		  P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001) lower for blacks than
		  for whites matched also on treatment. In the presentation
		  match, fewer blacks received treatment (87.4\% vs 91.8\%;
		  P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001), time from diagnosis
		  to treatment was longer (29.2 vs 22.8 days;
		  P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001), use of
		  anthracyclines and taxols was lower (3.7\% vs 5.0\%;
		  P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001), and
		  breast-conserving surgery without other treatment was more
		  frequent (8.2\% vs 7.3\%;
		  P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}=\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.04). Nevertheless,
		  differences in survival associated with treatment
		  differences accounted for only 0.81\% of the 12.9\%
		  survival difference. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the
		  SEER-Medicare database, differences in breast cancer
		  survival between black and white women did not
		  substantially change among women diagnosed between 1991 and
		  2005. These differences in survival appear primarily
		  related to presentation characteristics at diagnosis rather than treatment differences},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Develop an improved method for auditing
		  hospital cost and quality.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA
		  SOURCES/SETTING: Medicare claims in general, gynecologic
		  and urologic surgery, and orthopedics from Illinois, Texas,
		  and New York between 2004 and
		  2006.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN: A template of
		  300 representative patients was constructed and then used
		  to match 300 patients at hospitals that had a minimum of
		  500 patients over a 3-year study
		  period.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION
		  METHODS: From each of 217 hospitals we chose 300 patients
		  most resembling the template using multivariate
		  matching.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The
		  matching algorithm found close matches on procedures and
		  patient characteristics, far more balanced than measured
		  covariates would be in a randomized clinical trial. These
		  matched samples displayed little to no differences across
		  hospitals in common patient characteristics yet found large
		  and statistically significant hospital variation in
		  mortality, complications, failure-to-rescue, readmissions,
		  length of stay, ICU days, cost, and surgical procedure
		  length. Similar patients at different hospitals had
		  substantially different
		  outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The
		  template-matched sample can produce fair, directly
		  standardized audits that evaluate hospitals on patients
		  with similar characteristics, thereby making benchmarking
		  more believable. Through examining matched samples of
		  individual patients, administrators can better detect poor
		  performance at their hospitals and better understand why
		  these problems are occurring.},

	Abstract = {The fact is, economics is not an experimental science and
		  cannot be. ``Natural'' experiments and ``quasi''
		  experiments are not in fact experiments. They are
		  rhetorical devices that are often invoked to avoid having
		  to confront real econometric difficulties. Natural, quasi-,
		  and computational experiments, as well as regression
		  discontinuity design, can all, when well applied, be
		  useful, but none are panaceas. The essay by Angrist and
		  Pischke, in its enthusiasm for some real accomplishments in
		  certain subfields of economics, makes overbroad claims for
		  its favored methodologies. What the essay says about
		  macroeconomics is mainly nonsense. Consequently, I devote
		  the central part of my comment to describing the main
		  developments that have helped take some of the con out of
		  macroeconomics. Recent enthusiasm for single-equation,
		  linear, instrumental variables approaches in applied
		  microeconomics has led many in these fields to avoid
		  undertaking research that would require them to think
		  formally },

@article{sinclair2012a,
	Abstract = {Interpersonal communication presents a methodological
		  challenge and a research opportunity for researchers
		  involved in field experiments. The challenge is that
		  communication among subjects blurs the line between
		  treatment and control conditions. When treatment effects
		  are transmitted from subject to subject, the stable unit
		  treatment value assumption (SUTVA) is violated, and
		  comparison of treatment and control outcomes may provide a
		  biased assessment of the treatment's causal influence.
		  Social scientists are increasingly interested in the
		  substantive phenomena that lead to SUTVA violations, such
		  as communication in advance of an election. Experimental
		  designs that gauge SUTVA violations provide useful insights
		  into the extent and influence of interpersonal
		  communication. This article illustrates the value of one
		  such design, a multilevel experiment in which treatments
		  are randomly assigned to individuals and varying
		  proportions of their neighbors. After describing the
		  theoretical and statistical underpinnings of this design,
		  we apply it to a large-scale voter-mobilization experiment
		  conducted in Chicago during a special election in 2009
		  using social-pressure mailings that highlight individual
		  electoral participation. We find some evidence of
		  within-household spillovers but no evidence of spillovers
		  across households. We conclude by discussing how multilevel
		  designs might be employed in other substantive domains,
		  such as the study of deterrence and policy diffusion.},

@misc{small2008a,
	Abstract = {An instrument manipulates a treatment that it does not
		  entirely control, but the instrument affects the outcome
		  only indirectly through its manipulation of the treatment.
		  The idealized prototype is the randomized encouragement
		  design, in which subjects are randomly assigned to receive
		  either encouragement to accept the treatment or no such
		  encouragement, but not all subjects comply by doing what
		  they are encouraged to do, and the situation is such that
		  only the treatment itself, not disregarded encouragement
		  alone, can affect the outcome. An instrument is weak if it
		  has only a slight impact on acceptance of the treatment,
		  that is, if most people disregard encouragement to accept
		  the treatment. Typical applications of instrumental
		  variables are not ideal; encouragement is not randomized,
		  although it may be assigned in a far less biased manner
		  than the treatment itself. Using the concept of design
		  sensitivity, we study the sensitivity of instrumental
		  variable analyses to departures from the ideal of random
		  assignment of encouragement, with particular reference to
		  the strength of the instrument. With these issues in mind,
		  we reanalyze a clever study by Angrist and Krueger
		  concerning the effects of military service during World War
		  II on subsequent earnings, in which birth cohorts of very
		  similar but not identical age were differently
		  ``encouraged'' to serve in the war. A striking feature of
		  this example is that those who served earned more, but the
		  effect of service on earnings appears to be negative; that
		  is, the instrumental variables analysis reverses the sign
		  of the naive comparison. For expository purposes, this
		  example has the convenient feature of enabling, by
		  selecting different birth cohorts, the creation of
		  instruments of varied strength, from extremely weak to
		  fairly strong, although separated by the same time interval
		  and thus perhaps similarly biased. No matter how large the
		  sample size becomes, even if the effect under study is
		  quite large, studies with weak instruments are extremely
		  sensitive to tiny biases, whereas studies with stronger
		  instruments can be insensitive to moderate biases.},

	Abstract = {A predictor variable or dose that is measured with
		  substantial error may possess an error-free milestone, such
		  that it is known with negligible error whether the value of
		  the variable is to the left or right of the milestone. Such
		  a milestone provides a basis for estimating a linear
		  relationship between the true but unknown value of the
		  error-free predictor and an outcome, because the milestone
		  creates a strong and valid instrumental variable. The
		  inferences are nonparametric and robust, and in the
		  simplest cases, they are exact and distribution free. We
		  also consider multiple milestones for a single predictor
		  and milestones for several predictors whose partial slopes
		  are estimated simultaneously. Examples are drawn from the
		  Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, in which a BA degree acts as
		  a milestone for sixteen years of education, and the binary
		  indicator of military service acts as a milestone for years
		  of service.},

	Abstract = {This paper attempts to further theoretical and empirical
		  understanding of adherent and constituent mobilization by
		  proposing and analyzing frame alignment as a conceptual
		  bridge linking social psychological and resource
		  mobilization views on movement participation. Extension of
		  Goffman's (1974) frame analytic perspective provides the
		  conceptual/theoretical framework; field research on two
		  religious movements, the peace movement, and several
		  neighborhood movements provide the primary empirical base.
		  Four frame alignment processes are identified and
		  elaborated: frame bridging, frame amplification, frame
		  extension, and frame transformation. The basic underlying
		  premise is that frame alignment, of one variety or another,
		  is a necessary condition for participation, whatever its
		  nature or intensity, and that it is typically an
		  interactional and ongoing accomplishment. The paper
		  concludes with an elaboration of several sets of
		  theoretical and research implications.},

	Abstract = {In the portion of the paper translated here, Neyman
		  introduces a model for the analysis of field experiments
		  conducted for the purpose of comparing a number of crop
		  varieties, which makes use of a double-indexed array of
		  unknown potential yields, one index corresponding to
		  varieties and the other to plots. The yield corresponding
		  to only one variety will be observed on any given plot, but
		  through an urn model embodying sampling without replacement
		  from this doubly indexed array, Neyman obtains a formula
		  for the variance of the difference between the averages of
		  the observed yields of two varieties. This variance
		  involves the variance over all plots of the potential
		  yields and the correlation coefficient r between the
		  potential yields of the two varieties on the same plot.
		  Since it is impossible to estimate r directly, Neyman
		  advises taking r = 1, observing that in practice this may
		  lead to using too large an estimated standard deviation,
		  when comparing two variety means.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops asymptotic distribution theory for
		  single-equation instrumental variables regression when the
		  partial correlations between the instruments and the
		  endogenous variables are weak, here modeled as local to
		  zero. Asymptotic representations are provided for various
		  statistics, including mio-stage least squares (TSLS) and
		  limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimators,
		  Wald statistics, and statistics testing overidentification
		  and endogeneity. The asymptotic distributions are found to
		  provide good approximations to sampling distributions with
		  10-20 observations per instrument. The theory suggests
		  concrete guidelines for applied work, including using
		  nonstandard methods for construction of confidence regions.
		  These results are used to interpret Angrist and Krueger's
		  (1991) estimates of the returns to education: whereas TSLS
		  estimates with many instruments approach the OLS estimate
		  of 6\%, the more reliable LIML estimates with fewer
		  instruments fall between 8\% and 10\%, with a typical 95\%
		  confidence interval of (5\%, 15\%).},

	Abstract = {Multilevel data are structures that consist of multiple
		  units of analysis, one nested within the other. Such data
		  are becoming quite common in political science and provide
		  numerous opportunities for theory testing and development.
		  Unfortunately, this type of data typically generates a
		  number of statistical problems, of which clustering is
		  particularly important. To exploit the opportunities
		  offered by multilevel data, and to solve the statistical
		  problems inherent in them, special statistical techniques
		  are required. In this article, we focus on a technique that
		  has become popular in educational statistics and
		  sociology-multilevel analysis. In multilevel analysis,
		  researchers build models that capture the layered structure
		  of multilevel data, and determine how layers interact and
		  impact a dependent variable of interest. Our objective in
		  this article is to introduce the logic and statistical
		  theory behind multilevel models, to illustrate how such
		  models can be applied fruitfully in political science, and
		  to call attention to some of the pitfalls in multilevel
		  analysis.},

	Abstract = {Summary.  The paper presents a method for estimating the
		  effects of a policy change on an outcome distribution that
		  uses a comparator quantile rather than a control group and
		  provides methods for estimating the variances of the
		  estimators. The empirical analysis presents estimates of
		  `spillover' effects of increases in the UK minimum wage,
		  i.e. effects on the wages of those who are already above
		  the minimum, under various counterfactual distribution
		  shift assumptions. Evidence is presented against a simple
		  scaled counterfactual. On the basis of the proposed
		  counterfactual estimated spillover effects are small and in
		  most cases do not reach above the fifth percentile.},

	Abstract = {Angrist and Pischke highlight one aspect of the research
		  that has positively transformed econometric practice and
		  teaching. They emphasize the rise of experiments and
		  quasi-experiments as credible sources of identification in
		  microeconometric studies, which they usefully term
		  ``design-based research.'' But in so doing, they miss an
		  important part of the story: a second research strand aimed
		  at developing tools for inference that are robust to
		  subsidiary modeling assumptions. My first aim in these
		  remarks therefore is to highlight some key developments in
		  this area. I then turn to Angrist and Pischke's call for
		  adopting experiments and quasi-experiments in
		  macroeconometrics; while sympathetic, I suspect the scope
		  for such studies is limited. I conclude with some
		  observations on the current debate about whether
		  experimental methods have gone too far in abandoning
		  economic theory. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	Abstract = {Three main lines of arguments are presented as a defense
		  of randomization in experimental design. The first concerns
		  the computational advantages of randomizing when a
		  well-defined underlying theoretical model is not available,
		  as is often the case in much experimentation in the medical
		  and social sciences. The high desirability, even for the
		  most dedicated Bayesians, of physical randomization in some
		  special cases is stressed. The second line of argument
		  concerns communication of methodology and results,
		  especially in terms of concerns about bias. The third line
		  of argument concerns the use of randomization to guarantee
		  causal inferences, whether the inference consists of the

	Abstract = {Nie, Junn, and Stehlik-Barry (1996) develop a theory in
		  which relative, rather than absolute education determines
		  political participation. Empirical tests of this theory
		  have been unable to isolate the effect of education from
		  other factors that impact participation. We propose an
		  alternative definition in which education is measured
		  relative to those born in the same year. This is used to
		  estimate a model of voter turnout that controls for both
		  absolute and relative education. The results show that this
		  new measure of relative education has far more explanatory
		  power than does absolute education. This finding has
		  significant implications regarding how education affects
		  both aggregate voter turnout levels and inequality in voter
		  participation.},

		  corporatization of the organic food movement is an example
		  of co-optation. Co-optation theory conceptualizes the
		  commercial marketplace as an ideological force that
		  assimilates the symbols and practices of a counterculture
		  into dominant norms. Our alternative argument is that
		  co-optation can generate a countervailing market response
		  that actively promotes the oppositional aspects of a
		  counterculture attenuated by the process of commercial
		  mainstreaming. To develop this theoretical argument, we
		  analyze community-supported agriculture, which has emerged
		  in response to the corporate co-optation of the organic
		  food movement. We conclude by discussing how tacit
		  political ideologies structure consumption communities.},

	Abstract = {All empirical social research rests, at least implicitly,
		  on not one but two theories: a theory explaining the
		  phenomenon under study, another theory explaining the
		  generation of evidence concerning the phenomenon. The two
		  theories necessarily interact, setting important
		  constraints on each other. The second theory answers
		  questions about how the phenomenon leaves traces, how
		  analysts can observe those traces, and how analysts can
		  reconstruct attributes, elements, causes, and effects of
		  the phenomenon from those traces. As employed in studies of
		  contentious politics, event catalogs raise all these
		  questions. Competing conceptions of the phenomenon under
		  study as protest, as collective violence, as collective
		  action, as conflict, and as contentious claim-making imply
		  different measurement strategies. The strategy of
		  aggregation follows plausibly from identification of the
		  phenomenon as protest or violence, the strategy of
		  incidence from most of the competing conceptions, the
		  strategy of internal regularities only from treatments of
		  the crucial phenomenon as collective action, conflict, or
		  contentious claim-making.},

	Abstract = {Distinctions between quantitative and qualitative social
		  science misrepresent the actual choices confronting
		  analysts of observations concerning social processes.
		  Analysts regularly (if not always self-consciously) choose
		  between adopting and avoiding formal representations of
		  social processes. Despite widespread prejudices to the
		  contrary, formalisms are available and helpful for all
		  sorts of social scientific evidence, including those
		  commonly labeled as qualitative. Available formalisms vary
		  in two important regards: (1) from direct to analogical
		  representation of the evidence at hand; and (2) from
		  numerical to topological correspondence between formalism
		  and evidence. Adoption of formalisms facilitates the
		  identification of erroneous arguments, hence the correction
		  of analytic errors and the production of more adequate
		  explanations.},

		  measured outcome is well established and sample size
		  calculations are reasonably well understood. Analysis of

		  required. The focus in a random effects model for bivariate

		  between the random effects and between the bivariate
		  residuals. In the bivariate random effects model, we
		  estimate the asymptotic variances of the correlations and
		  we propose power calculations for testing and estimating

		  to variance estimates obtained from simulation studies and
		  compare our proposed power calculations for correlations on

	Abstract = {This article examines some problems of significance
		  testing for one-sided hypotheses of the form H0: {\^I}¸
		  {\^a} {\^I}¸0 versus $H_1: \theta > \theta_0$ , where
		  {\^I}¸ is the parameter of interest. In the usual setting,
		  let x be the observed data and let T(X) be a test statistic
		  such that the family of distributions of T(X) is
		  stochastically increasing in {\^I}¸. Define Cx as {X: T(X)
		  - T(x) {\^a} 0}. The p value is $p(x) = \sup_{\theta \leq
		  \theta_0} \Pr(X \in C_x \mid \theta)$ . In the presence of
		  a nuisance parameter {\^I}·, there may not exist a
		  nontrivial Cx with a p value independent of {\^I}·. We
		  consider tests based on generalized extreme regions of the
		  form Cx({\^I}¸, {\^I}·) = {X: T(X; x, {\^I}¸, {\^I}·)
		  {\^a} T(x; x, {\^I}¸, {\^I}·)}, and conditions on T(X, x,
		  {\^I}¸, {\^I}·) are given such that the p value $p(x) =
		  \sup_{\theta \leq \theta_0} Pr(X \in C_x \mid \theta)$ is
		  free of the nuisance parameter {\^I}·, where T is
		  stochastically increasing in {\^I}¸. We provide a solution
		  to the problem of testing hypotheses about the differences
		  in means of two independent exponential distributions, a
		  problem for which the fixed-level testing approach has not
		  produced a nontrivial solution except in a special case. We
		  also provide an exact solution to the Behrens-Fisher
		  problem. The p value for the Behrens-Fisher problem turns
		  out to be numerically (but not logically) the same as
		  Jeffreys's Bayesian solution and the Behrens-Fisher
		  fiducial solution. Our approach of testing on the basis of
		  p values is especially useful in multiparameter problems
		  where nontrivial tests with a fixed level of significance
		  are difficult or impossible to obtain.},

	Abstract = {{With <I>Visual Explanations</I>, Edward R. Tufte adds a
		  third volume to his indispensable series on information
		  display. The first, <I>The Visual Display of Quantitative
		  Information,</I> which focuses on charts and graphs that
		  display numerical information, virtually defined the field.
		  The second, <I>Envisioning Information,</I> explores
		  similar territory but with an emphasis on maps and
		  cartography. <I>Visual Explanations</I> centers on dynamic
		  data--information that changes over time. (Tufte has
		  described the three books as being about, respectively,
		  ``pictures of numbers, pictures of nouns, and pictures of
		  verbs.'') <P> Like its predecessors, <I>Visual
		  Explanations</I> is both intellectually stimulating and
		  beautiful to behold. Tufte, a self-publisher, takes
		  extraordinary pains with design and production. The book
		  ranges through a variety of topics, including the explosion
		  of the space shuttle <I>Challenger</I> (which could have
		  been prevented, Tufte argues, by better information display
		  on the part of the rocket's engineers), magic tricks, a
		  cholera epidemic in 19th-century London, and the principle
		  of using ``the smallest effective difference'' to display
		  distinctions in data. Throughout, Tufte presents ideas with
		  crystalline clarity and illustrates them in exquisitely
		  rendered samples.}},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews the problems that bedevil the selection
		  of an appropriate test for the analysis of a 2 \&#215; 2
		  table. In contradiction to an earlier paper, the author now
		  argues the case for the use of Fisher's exact test. It is
		  noted that all test statistics for the 2 \&#215; 2 table
		  have discrete distributions and it is suggested that it is
		  irrational to prescribe an unattainable fixed significance
		  level. The use of mid-P is suggested, if a formula is
		  required for prescribing a variable tail probability. The
		  problems of two-tail tests are discussed.},

@article{vanbavel2016,
	Abstract = {In recent years, scientists have paid increasing attention
		  to reproducibility. For example, the Reproducibility
		  Project, a large-scale replication attempt of 100 studies
		  published in top psychology journals found that only 39{\%}
		  could be unambiguously reproduced. There is a growing
		  consensus among scientists that the lack of reproducibility
		  in psychology and other fields stems from various
		  methodological factors, including low statistical power,
		  researcher's degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on
		  publishing surprising positive results. However, there is a
		  contentious debate about the extent to which failures to
		  reproduce certain results might also reflect contextual
		  differences (often termed "hidden moderators") between the
		  original research and the replication attempt. Although
		  psychologists have found extensive evidence that contextual
		  factors alter behavior, some have argued that context is
		  unlikely to influence the results of direct replications
		  precisely because these studies use the same methods as
		  those used in the original research. To help resolve this
		  debate, we recoded the 100 original studies from the
		  Reproducibility Project on the extent to which the research
		  topic of each study was contextually sensitive. Results
		  suggested that the contextual sensitivity of the research
		  topic was associated with replication success, even after
		  statistically adjusting for several methodological
		  characteristics (e.g., statistical power, effect size). The
		  association between contextual sensitivity and replication
		  success did not differ across psychological subdisciplines.
		  These results suggest that researchers, replicators, and
		  consumers should be mindful of contextual factors that
		  might influence a psychological process. We offer several
		  guidelines for dealing with contextual sensitivity in
		  reproducibility.},

	Abstract = {Analyses of social network data have suggested that
		  obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness all travel
		  through social networks. Individuals exert ``contagion
		  effects'' on one another through social ties and
		  association. These analyses have come under critique
		  because of the possibility that homophily from unmeasured
		  factors may explain these statistical associations and
		  because similar findings can be obtained when the same
		  methodology is applied to height, acne, and headaches, for
		  which the conclusion of contagion effects seems somewhat
		  less plausible. The author uses sensitivity analysis
		  techniques to assess the extent to which supposed contagion
		  effects for obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness
		  might be explained away by homophily or confounding and the
		  extent to which the critique using analysis of data on
		  height, acne, and headaches is relevant. Sensitivity
		  analyses suggest that contagion effects for obesity and
		  smoking cessation are reasonably robust to possible latent
		  homophily or environmental confounding; those for happiness
		  and loneliness are somewhat less so. Supposed effects for
		  height, acne, and headaches are all easily explained away
		  by latent homophily and confounding. The methodology that
		  has been used in past studies for contagion effects in
		  social networks, when used in conjunction with sensitivity
		  analysis, may prove useful in establishing social influence
		  for various behaviors and states. The sensitivity analysis
		  approach can be used to address the critique of latent
		  homophily as a possible explanation of associations
		  interpreted as contagion effects.},

	Abstract = {Utopian thinking consists of formulating proposals for
		  radical reforms, justifying them on the basis of normative
		  principles combined with the best possible scientific
		  analysis of the root causes of the problems the proposals
		  are meant to address, and subjecting these proposals to
		  unindulgent critical scrutiny. Such utopian thinking is
		  indispensable, and contributing to it is part of
		  sociology's core business. This article illustrates these
		  claims by considering one particular utopian proposal: an
		  unconditional basic income paid to every member of society
		  on an individual basis, without means test or work
		  requirement. It summarizes the main arguments that support
		  this proposal, mentions a number of contexts in which it is
		  being taken seriously, and sketches a number of ways in
		  which sociological insights and research are crucially
		  relevant to the discussion of the economic and political
		  sustainability of an unconditional basic income.},

	Abstract = {Civilians constitute a large share of casualties in civil
		  wars across the world. They are targeted to create fear and
		  punish allegiance with the enemy. This maximizes
		  collaboration with the perpetrator and strengthens the
		  support network necessary to consolidate control over
		  contested regions. I develop a model of the magnitude and
		  structure of civilian killings in civil wars involving two
		  armed groups who ght over territorial control. Armies
		  secure compliance through a combination of carrots and
		  sticks. In turn, civilians dier from each other in their
		  intrinsic preference towards one group. I explore the eect
		  of the empowerment of one of the groups in the civilian
		  death toll. There are two eects that go in opposite
		  directions. While a direct eect makes the powerful group
		  more lethal, there is an indirect eect by which the number
		  of civilians who align with that group increases, leaving
		  less enemy supporters to kill. I study the conditions under
		  which there is one dominant eect and illustrate the
		  predictions using sub-national longitudinal data for
		  Colombia's civil war.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:This paper explores the implementation and
		  sustenance of universal health coverage (UHC) in Costa
		  Rica, discussing the development of a social security
		  scheme that covered 5\% of the population in 1940, to one
		  that finances and provides comprehensive healthcare to the
		  whole population today. The scheme is financed by
		  mandatory, tri-partite social insurance contributions
		  complemented by tax funding to cover the poor.METHODS:The
		  analysis takes a historical perspective and explores the
		  policy process including the key actors and their relative
		  influence in decision-making. Data were collected using
		  qualitative research instruments, including a review of
		  literature, institutional and other documents, and in-depth
		  interviews with key informants.RESULTS:Key lessons to be
		  learned are: i) population health was high on the political
		  agenda in Costa Rica, in particular before the 1980s when
		  UHC was enacted and the transfer of hospitals to the social
		  security institution took place. Opposition to UHC could
		  therefore be contained through negotiation and implemented
		  incrementally despite the absence of real consensus among
		  the policy elite; ii) since the 1960s, the social security
		  institution has been responsible for UHC in Costa Rica.
		  This institution enjoys financial and managerial autonomy
		  relative to the general government, which has also
		  facilitated the UHC policy implementation process; iii) UHC
		  was simultaneously constructed on three pillars that
		  reciprocally strengthened each other: increasing population
		  coverage, increasing availability of financial resources
		  based on solidarity financing mechanisms, and increasing
		  service coverage, ultimately offering comprehensive health
		  services and the same benefits to every resident in the
		  country; iv) particularly before the 1980s, the fruits of
		  economic growth were structurally invested in health and
		  other universal social policies, in particular education
		  and sanitation. The social security institution became a
		  flagship of Costa Rica's national development strategy
		  which reinforced its political importance and contributed
		  to its longer-term sustainability and that of
		  UHC.CONCLUSIONS:UHC has been achieved in Costa Rica because
		  it was supported at the highest political level within a
		  favourable socio-economic and political context. Once
		  achieved, UHC became an entitlement for the population and
		  now enjoys broad public support.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Earlier work demonstrated that ACGME duty hour
		  reform did not adversely affect mortality, with slight
		  improvement noted among specific subgroups. OBJECTIVE: To
		  determine whether resident duty hour reform differentially
		  affected the mortality risk of high severity patients or
		  patients who experienced post-operative complications
		  (failure-to-rescue). DESIGN: Observational study using
		  interrupted time series analysis with data from July 1,
		  2000 - June 30, 2005. Fixed effects logistic regression was
		  used to examine the change in the odds of mortality or
		  failure-to-rescue (FTR) in more versus less
		  teaching-intensive hospitals before and after duty hour
		  reform. PARTICIPANTS: All unique Medicare patients (n =
		  8,529,595) admitted to short-term acute care non-federal
		  hospitals and all unique VA patients (n = 318,636 patients)
		  with principal diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction,
		  congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, stroke
		  or a DRG classification of general, orthopedic or vascular
		  surgery. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured
		  mortality within 30 days of hospital admission and FTR,
		  measured by death among patients who experienced a surgical
		  complication. The odds of mortality and FTR generally
		  changed at similar rates for higher and lower risk patients
		  in more vs. less teaching intensive hospitals. For example,
		  comparing the mortality risk for the 10\% of Medicare
		  patients with highest risk to the other 90\% of patients in
		  post-reform year 1 for combined medical an OR of 1.01 [95\%
		  CI 0.90, 1.13], for combined surgical an OR of 0.91 [95\%
		  CI 0.80, 1.04], and for FTR an OR of 0.94 [95\% CI 0.80,
		  1.09]. Findings were similar in year 2 for both Medicare
		  and VA. The two exceptions were a relative increase in
		  mortality for the highest risk medical (OR 1.63 [95\% CI
		  1.08, 2.46]) and a relative decrease in the high risk
		  surgical patients within VA in post-reform year 1 (OR 0.52
		  [95\% CI 0.29, 0.96]). CONCLUSIONS: ACGME duty hour reform
		  was not associated with any consistent improvements or
		  worsening in mortality or failure-to-rescue rates for high
		  risk medical or surgical patients.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores the impact of natural resource
		  dependence on democratic governance. I argue that when the
		  state institutions are weak and budget pro- cedures either
		  lack transparency or are discretionary, resource windfalls
		  tend to generate incumbency advantage authoritarian
		  governments. There is a strong empirical support for my
		  theoretical predictions. Controlling for GDP, human capital
		  and other possible determinants, I nd a robust and
		  statistically signif- icant impact of resource dependence
		  on the probability of authoritarianism. Since Norway is an
		  outlier according to my statistical ndings, I explain why
		  oil discoveries generated incumbency advantage and
		  political instability in Nigeria and not in Norway.},

		  Paradoxically, ethnic ties between voters and candidates
		  can increase the demand for national public goods. Ethnic

		  nature of its independence movements. Using various
		  measures of political regimes (1960-2010) and historical
		  data on anti-colonial insurgencies (c.1900 to year of
		  independence), we find that coun- tries that experienced
		  anti-colonial "rural" insurgencies tend to have autocratic
		  regimes, while those that experienced "urban" mass protests
		  tend to have more democratic institutions. We provide
		  evidence for causality of this relationship by using
		  terrain ruggedness as an instrument for rural insurgency
		  and by per- forming a sensitivity analysis that relaxes the
		  exclusion restriction (Conley et al 2012). Finally, we show
		  that non-violent forms of opposition to colonial rule fa-
		  cilitated the emergence of democracy by generating more

		  brutal and destructive civil war, the signs of continued
		  democratic transformation and pro-market economic reform
		  appear rosy, at least at first glance. Donors and the
		  international community have quietly lauded Joaquim
		  Chissano's recent announcement that he is ``not disposed''
		  to seek a third term as president of this former Portuguese
		  colony of 17 million on the southeast coast of Africa.
		  Together with President Frederick Chiluba's similar
		  announcement in Zambia a few months ago, it looks to many
		  like an indication that these two African democracies are
		  maturing and consolidating the gains that they have made in
		  recent years. Mozambique's continued place atop the list of
		  the world's fastestgrowing economies has been seen as
		  another signal that commitment to the ``Washington
		  Consensus'' will provide the funds required to bring
		  infrastructure, schools, and health care to the rural
		  majority. It is no wonder, then, that Mozambique finds
		  itself highlighted as a success story for the United
		  Nations in conflict-ridden Africa. Many credit Mozambique's
		  remarkable transformation to the UN's efforts to sustain
		  the drawn-out peace negotiations, demobilize more than
		  90,000 soldiers, rebuild a unified national army, and
		  foster the rise of a legitimate, peaceful opposition. Donor
		  investments continue to support Mozambique today, funding
		  more than half of the government's annual budget.},

@article{weinstein2012,
	Abstract = {Bringing open data and open government under a single
		  banner, Yu and Robinson argue, leads to conceptual muddling
		  that ultimately impedes progress for both projects. Th ey
		  express a concern that superfi cial commitments to open
		  data ``can placate the public's appetite for
		  transparency.'' Drawing on our experiences with the Kenya
		  Open Data Initiative and the Open Government Partnership,
		  we argue that this need not be the case for three reasons.
		  First, a commitment to open data involves reorienting the
		  production of information in a public bureaucracy in ways
		  that have the potential to institutionalize a commitment to
		  openness. Second, an open data campaign can accelerate
		  demand for information and generate a public conversation
		  about what kind of data matter for accountability. Finally,
		  the two movements may be stronger together. Th e open data
		  movement helps open government advocates focus on the end
		  user's needs and the possibilities of new technologies,
		  while open government campaigners challenge open data
		  advocates to focus on how transparency and technology can
		  be leveraged for civic accountability. While it is too
		  early to tell how these movements will play out, we believe
		  that bringing these movements under the same big tent,
		  coherently aligning their strategies, goals, and
		  priorities, might ultimately be helpful for citizens
		  interested in promoting openness in their own countries},

	Abstract = {A general method for constructing permutation tests for
		  various experimental designs follows from invariance and
		  sufficiency. In this framework, randomization (or
		  rerandomization) tests are just special cases of
		  permutation tests. The methodology extends the
		  applicability of permutation tests: An example demonstrates
		  a test for an interaction effect in a factorial experiment,
		  a problem thought to be unapproachable by permutation or
		  randomization methods. Tests are constructed as follows.
		  The modeling of block and treatment effects closely
		  parallels classical analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA
		  assumptions of iid normal random errors are replaced,
		  however, by the much weaker assumption of exchangeability
		  of subsets of random errors. Distributional dependences on
		  the unknown nuisance parameters for blocks, covariates, and
		  untested treatments and on the unknown error distribution
		  are eliminated by invariance and sufficiency, respectively.
		  Initial reduction of the data by invariance appears to
		  extend considerably the applicability of permutation tests.
		  Because of the assumed exchangeability of the errors, the
		  sufficiency step leads to data permutations when computing
		  the test. The method also addresses some philosophical
		  problems associated with randomization tests. For instance,
		  in this article's framework, it is the design, and not the
		  data, which is always regarded as fixed, so ancillarity of
		  the design causes no difficulty.},

		  norms of fairness. Once violence is a foregone conclusion,
		  will cooperative norms ever (re-)emerge beyond ethnic
		  boundaries? We use an experiment that measures how fairly
		  individuals in a postconflict setting treat their own
		  ingroup in comparison to the outgroups---in this case,
		  examining the behavior of 681 Muslims, Croats, and Serbs in
		  postwar Bosnia-Herzegovina. To assess fairness, we use the
		  dictator game wherein subjects decide how to allocate a sum
		  of money between themselves and an anonymous counterpart of
		  varying ethnicity. We find that the effects of ethnicity on
		  decision making are captured by our experiments. Although
		  results indicate preferential ingroup treatment, the
		  incidence and magnitude of outgroup bias is much less than
		  expected. We conclude that norms of fairness across
		  ethnicity are remarkably strong in Bosnia, and we take this
		  to be a positive sign for reconciliation after violent
		  conflict.},

	Abstract = {When experimental designs are infeasible, researchers must
		  resort to the use of observational data from surveys,
		  censuses, and administrative records. Because assignment to
		  the independent variables of observational data is usually
		  nonrandom, the challenge of estimating causal effects with
		  observational data can be formidable. In this chapter, we
		  review the large literature produced primarily by
		  statisticians and econometricians in the past two decades
		  on the estimation of causal effects from observational
		  data. We first review the now widely accepted
		  counterfactual framework for the modeling of causal
		  effects. After examining estimators, both old and new, that
		  can be used to estimate causal effects from cross-sectional
		  data, we present estimators that exploit the additional
		  information furnished by longitudinal data. Because of the
		  size and technical nature of the literature, we cannot
		  offer a fully detailed and comprehensive presentation.
		  Instead, we present only the main features of methods that
		  are accessible and potentially of use to quantitatively
		  oriented sociologists.},

@article{wold:1954,
	Abstract = {Much controversy about causality and related concepts has
		  arisen in the philosophical literature, and the haze
		  surrounding the discussion has spread to other fields,
		  among them econometrics. This brief outline stresses
		  certain general principles and ideas that are relevant for
		  actual research activity in the natural and social
		  sciences. The main points are: (1) The concept of causality
		  is indispensable and fundamental to all science; (2) The
		  controversial issues are not latent in the concept of
		  causality itself, but in certain questionable hypotheses,
		  so-called {"}laws of causality,{"} such as the universal
		  scope of causality, the certainty (irrevocability) of a
		  cause-effect relationship, the connection of causality with
		  theories of induction, the principles of determinism and
		  freedom of the will, etc; (3) A definition of causality
		  which seems to be adequate from both common-sense and
		  scientific points of view is suggested with reference to
		  the well-known situation of the controlled experiment; (4)
		  Some general remarks on statistical methods from the
		  viewpoint of the dual distinction between descriptive and
		  explanatory analysis and between experimental and
		  nonexperimental observations are made; (5-6) Some comments
		  are offered on causal relations as a tool in econometrics,
		  with special regard to the rationale of different types of
		  economic models.},

	Abstract = {This book shows how ordinary Americans imagine their
		  communities and the extent to which their communities'
		  boundaries determine who they believe should benefit from
		  the government's resources via redistributive policies. By
		  contributing extensive empirical analyses to a largely
		  theoretical discussion, it highlights the subjective nature
		  of communities while confronting the elusive task of
		  pinning down "pictures in people's heads." A deeper
		  understanding of people's definitions of their communities
		  and how they affect feelings of duties and obligations
		  provides a new lens through which to look at diverse
		  societies and the potential for both civic solidarity and
		  humanitarian aid. This book analyzes three different types
		  of communities and more than eight national surveys. Wong
		  finds that the decision to help only those within certain
		  borders and ignore the needs of those outside rests, to a
		  certain extent, on whether and how people translate their
		  sense of community into obligations.
		  
		  Book Description Based on analysis of three types of
		  communities and eight national surveys, this book examines
		  how ordinary Americans imagine their communities. Wong
		  concludes that people's definition of their community and

		  which mixing qualitative and quantitative methods could add
		  value to monitoring and evaluating development projects. In
		  particular it examines how qualitative methods could
		  address some of the limitations of randomized trials and
		  other quantitative impact evaluation methods; it also
		  explores the importance of examining "process" in addition
		  to "impact", distinguishing design from implementation
		  failures, and the value of mixed methods in the real-time
		  monitoring of projects. It concludes by suggesting topics
		  for future research -- including the use of mixed methods
		  in constructing counterfactuals, and in conducting

	Abstract = {The consensus among scholars and policymakers that
		  ``institutions matter'' for development has led inexorably
		  to a conclusion that ``history matters,'' since
		  institutions clearly form and evolve over time.
		  Unfortunately, however, the next logical step has not yet
		  been taken, which is to recognize that historians (and not
		  only economic historians) might also have useful and
		  distinctive insights to offer. This paper endeavors to open
		  and sustain a constructive dialogue between history---
		  understood as both ``the past'' and ``the
		  discipline''---and development policy by (a) clarifying
		  what the craft of This paper---a product of the Poverty and
		  Inequality Team, Development Research Group---is part of a
		  larger effort in the department to understand the origins
		  and consequences of inequitable institutions, policies and
		  practices. Policy Research Working Papers are also posted

		  mechanisms, contexts, and complex processes of
		  institutional change; (b) providing examples of historical
		  research that support, qualify, or challenge the most
		  influential research (by economists and economic
		  historians) in contemporary development policy; and (c)

	Abstract = {{It has become common to lament Americans' tendency to
		  pursue individual interests apart from any institutional
		  association. But to those who charge that Americans are at
		  home watching television rather than getting involved in
		  their communities, Robert Wuthnow answers that while
		  certain kinds of civic engagement may be declining,
		  innovative new forms are taking their place. People are
		  still connected, but because of the realities of daily
		  life, they form ``loose connections.'' These more fluid
		  groups are better suited to dealing with today's needs than
		  the fraternal orders and ladies' auxiliaries of the past.
		  Wuthnow examines the challenges that must be faced if these
		  innovative forms of civic involvement are to flourish.
		  ``America has always been a nation of joiners. Loose
		  Connections argues that we still have the habit, and it is
		  a good one, of reaching out and connecting to others in
		  order to participate in the civic life of our culture.
		  Wuthnow is an indispensable observer of the American civic
		  and religious scene.'' --Jean Bethke Elshtain, author of
		  Democracy on Trial ``This is a very important book,
		  especially in the context of the current debate over
		  'social capital' in America. Wuthnow presents an optimistic
		  picture of the state of American voluntary institutions.
		  One might sum up his view by saying that Alexis de
		  Tocqueville has still not been proven wrong.'' --Peter

	Abstract = {Summary In multivariate matching, fine balance constrains
		  the marginal distributions of a nominal variable in treated
		  and matched control groups to be identical without
		  constraining who is matched to whom. In this way, a fine
		  balance constraint can balance a nominal variable with many
		  levels while focusing efforts on other more important
		  variables when pairing individuals to minimize the total
		  covariate distance within pairs. Fine balance is not always
		  possible; that is, it is a constraint on an optimization
		  problem, but the constraint is not always feasible. We
		  propose a new algorithm that returns a minimum distance
		  finely balanced match when one is feasible, and otherwise
		  minimizes the total distance among all matched samples that
		  minimize the deviation from fine balance. Perhaps we can
		  come very close to fine balance when fine balance is not
		  attainable; moreover, in any event, because our algorithm
		  is guaranteed to come as close as possible to fine balance,
		  the investigator may perform one match, and on that basis
		  judge whether the best attainable balance is adequate or
		  not. We also show how to incorporate an additional
		  constraint. The algorithm is implemented in two similar
		  ways, first as an optimal assignment problem with an
		  augmented distance matrix, second as a minimum cost flow
		  problem in a network. The case of knee surgery in the
		  Obesity and Surgical Outcomes Study motivated the
		  development of this algorithm and is used as an
		  illustration. In that example, 2 of 47 hospitals had too
		  few nonobese patients to permit fine balance for the
		  nominal variable with 47 levels representing the hospital,
		  but our new algorithm came very close to fine balance.
		  Moreover, in that example, there was a shortage of nonobese
		  diabetic patients, and incorporation of an additional
		  constraint forced the match to include all of these
		  nonobese diabetic patients, thereby coming as close as
		  possible to balance for this important but recalcitrant

	Abstract = {The classical approach to the study of the transformation
		  of social movements (here called the Weber-Michels model)
		  predicts that a movement organization will become more
		  conservative and that its goals will be displaced in favor
		  of organizational maintenance. Using organizational and
		  incentive analysis, the classical approach is subsumed
		  under a more general set of concepts which lead to
		  predictions about growth and change. The movement
		  organization responds to the ebb and flow of sentiment in
		  the larger society, to its relations with other movement
		  organizations and to success or failure. Leadership and
		  schismogenetic tendencies affect the nature and
		  vicissitudes of its goals, and the recruitment and
		  commitment of members. Neither greater conservatism nor
		  organizational maintenance are iron laws.},

	Abstract = {In a randomized trial, subjects are assigned to treatment
		  or control by the flip of a fair coin. In many
		  nonrandomized or observational studies, subjects find their
		  way to treatment or control in two steps, either or both of
		  which may lead to biased comparisons. By a vague process,
		  perhaps affected by proximity or sociodemographic issues,
		  subjects find their way to institutions that provide
		  treatment. Once at such an institution, a second process,
		  perhaps thoughtful and deliberate, assigns individuals to
		  treatment or control. In the current article, the
		  institutions are hospitals, and the treatment under study
		  is the use of general anesthesia alone versus some use of
		  regional anesthesia during surgery. For a specific
		  operation, the use of regional anesthesia may be typical in
		  one hospital and atypical in another. A new matched design
		  is proposed for studies of this sort, one that creates two
		  types of nonoverlapping matched pairs. Using a new
		  extension of optimal matching with fine balance, pairs of
		  the first type exactly balance treatment assignment across
		  institutions, so each institution appears in the treated
		  group with the same frequency that it appears in the
		  control group; hence, differences between institutions that
		  affect everyone in the same way cannot bias this
		  comparison. Pairs of the second type compare institutions
		  that assign most subjects to treatment and other
		  institutions that assign most subjects to control, so each
		  institution is represented in the treated group if it
		  typically assigns subjects to treatment or, alternatively,
		  in the control group if it typically assigns subjects to
		  control, and no institution appears in both groups. By and
		  large, in the second type of matched pair, subjects became
		  treated subjects or controls by choosing an institution,
		  not by a thoughtful and deliberate process of selecting
		  subjects for treatment within institutions. The design
		  provides two evidence factors, that is, two tests of the
		  null hypothesis of no treatment effect that are independent
		  when the null hypothesis is true, where each factor is
		  largely unaffected by certain unmeasured biases that could
		  readily invalidate the other factor. The two factors permit
		  separate and combined sensitivity analyses, where the
		  magnitude of bias affecting the two factors may differ. The
		  case of knee surgery in the study of regional versus
		  general anesthesia is considered in detail.},

	Abstract = {In 2010, a magnitude 8.8 earthquake hit Chile, devastating
		  parts of the country. Having just completed its national
		  socioeconomic survey, the Chilean government reinterviewed
		  a subsample of respondents, creating unusual longitudinal
		  data about the same persons before and after a major
		  disaster. The follow-up evaluated posttraumatic stress
		  symptoms (PTSS) using Davidson's Trauma Scale. We use these
		  data with two goals in mind. Most studies of PTSS after
		  disasters rely on recall to characterize the state of
		  affairs before the disaster. We are able to use prospective
		  data on preexposure conditions, free of recall bias, to
		  study the effects of the earthquake. Second, we illustrate
		  recent developments in statistical methodology for the
		  design and analysis of observational studies. In
		  particular, we use new and recent methods for multivariate
		  matching to control 46 covariates that describe demographic
		  variables, housing quality, wealth, health, and health
		  insurance before the earthquake. We use the statistical
		  theory of design sensitivity to select a study design with
		  findings expected to be insensitive to small or moderate
		  biases from failure to control some unmeasured covariate.
		  PTSS were dramatically but unevenly elevated among
		  residents of strongly shaken areas of Chile when compared
		  with similar persons in largely untouched parts of the
		  country. In 96\% of exposed-control pairs exhibiting
		  substantial PTSS, it was the exposed person who experienced
		  stronger symptoms (95\% confidence interval = 0.91-1.00).},
