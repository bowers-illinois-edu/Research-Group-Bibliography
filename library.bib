In a cohort study, matching or stratifying treated and control subjects on a single variable, the propensity score, tends to balance all of the observed covariates; however, unlike random assignment of treatments, the propensity score may not also balance unobserved covariates. The authors review the uses and limitations of propensity scores and provide a brief outline of associated statistical theory. They also present a new result of using propensity scores in case-cohort studies.Am J Epidemiol 1999; 150: 327-33.},

The differential effect of the two treatments is the effect of applying one treatment in lieu of the other. In randomised experiments, the differential effect is of no more or less interest than other treatment contrasts. Differential effects play a special role in certain observational studies in which treatments are not assigned to subjects at random, where differing outcomes may reflect biased assignments rather than effects caused by the treatments. Differential effects are immune to certain types of unobserved bias, called generic biases, which are associated with both treatments in a similar way. This is explored using several examples and models. Differential effects are not immune to differential biases, whose possible consequences are examined by sensitivity analysis.},

abstract = {A predictor variable or dose that is measured with substantial error may possess an error-free milestone, such that it is known with negligible error whether the value of the variable is to the left or right of the milestone. Such a milestone provides a basis for estimating a linear relationship between the true but unknown value of the error-free predictor and an outcome, because the milestone creates a strong and valid instrumental variable. The inferences are nonparametric and robust, and in the simplest cases, they are exact and distribution free. We also consider multiple milestones for a single predictor and milestones for several predictors whose partial slopes are estimated simultaneously. Examples are drawn from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, in which a BA degree acts as a milestone for sixteen years of education, and the binary indicator of military service acts as a milestone for years of service.},

abstract = {Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for
linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory. The
procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro
implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the
strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of
overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies
directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The
impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and
information, mobility opportunity, and community
organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive
power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly,
with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to
small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends
itself to discussion of relations between groups and to
analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined
in terms of primary groups.},

conceptualization, development, and success of case-control
methods for the study of disease causation and prevention.
This article reviews the major developments. It starts with
Cornfield's demonstration of odds ratio invariance under
cohort versus case-control sampling, proceeds through the
still-popular Mantel-Haenszel procedure and its extensions
for dependent data, and highlights (conditional) likelihood
methods for relative risk regression. Recent work on nested
case-control, case-cohort, and two-stage case-control
designs demonstrates the continuing impact of statistical
thinking on epidemiology. The influence of R. A. Fisher's
work on these developments is mentioned wherever possible.
His objections to the drawing of causal conclusions from
observational data on cigarette smoking and lung cancer are
used to introduce the problems of measurement error and
confounding bias. The resolution of such difficulties,
whether by further development and implementation of
randomized intervention trials or by causal analysis of
observational data using graphical models containing latent
variables, will challenge future generations of
statisticians.},

@article{Rosenbaum2013,
abstract = {In an observational study, one treated subject may be matched for observed covariates to either one or several untreated controls. The common motivation for using several controls rather than one is to increase the power of a test of no effect under the doubtful assumption that matching for observed covariates suffices to remove bias from nonrandom treatment assignment. Does the choice between one or several matched controls affect the sensitivity of conclusions to violations of this doubtful assumption? With continuous responses, it is known that reducing the heterogeneity of matched pair differences reduces sensitivity to unmeasured biases, but increasing the sample size has a highly circumscribed effect on sensitivity to bias. Is the use of several controls rather than one analogous to a reduction in heterogeneity or to an increase in sample size? The issue is examined for Huber's m-statistics, including the t-test, the examination having three components: an example, asymptotic calculations using design sensitivity, and a simulation. Use of multiple controls with continuous responses yields a nontrivial reduction in sensitivity to unmeasured biases. An example looks at lead and cadmium in the blood of smokers from the 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A by-product of the discussion is a new result giving the design sensitivity for the permutation distribution of m-statistics.},

abstract = {In Infotopia, citizens enjoy a wide range of information about the organizations upon which they rely for the satisfaction of their vital interests. The provision of that information is governed by principles of democratic transparency. Democratic transparency both extends and critiques current enthusiasms about transparency. It urges us to conceptualize information politically, as a resource to turn the behavior of large organizations in socially beneficial ways. Transparency efforts have targets, and we should think of those targets as large organizations: public and civic, but especially private and corporate. Democratic transparency consists of four principles. First, information about the operations and actions of large organizations that affect citizens' interests should be rich, deep, and readily available to the public. Second, the amount of available information should be proportionate to the extent to which those organizations jeopardize citizens' interests. Third, information should be organized and provided in ways that are accessible to individuals and groups that use that information. Finally, the social, political, and economic structures of society should be organized in ways that allow individuals and groups to take action based on Infotopia's public disclosures.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) implemented duty hour regulations for physicians-in-training throughout the United States on July 1, 2003. The association of duty hour reform with mortality among patients in teaching hospitals nationally has not been well established. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the change in duty hour regulations was associated with relative changes in mortality among Medicare patients in hospitals of different teaching intensity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: An observational study of all unique Medicare patients (N = 8 529 595) admitted to short-term, acute-care, general US nonfederal hospitals (N = 3321) using interrupted time series analysis with data from July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2005. All Medicare patients had principal diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, or stroke or a diagnosis related group classification of general, orthopedic, or vascular surgery. Logistic regression was used to examine the change in mortality for patients in more vs less teaching-intensive hospitals before (academic years 2000-2003) and after (academic years 2003-2005) duty hour reform, adjusting for patient comorbidities, common time trends, and hospital site. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-location mortality within 30 days of hospital admission. RESULTS: In medical and surgical patients, no significant relative increases or decreases in the odds of mortality for more vs less teaching-intensive hospitals were observed in either postreform year 1 (combined medical conditions group: odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.07; and combined surgical categories group: OR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.12) or postreform year 2 (combined medical conditions group: OR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.99-1.08; and combined surgical categories group: OR, 1.01; 95\% CI, 0.95-1.08) compared with the prereform years. The only condition for which there was a relative increase in mortality in more teaching-intensive hospitals postreform was stroke, but this association preceded the onset of duty hour reform. Compared with nonteaching hospitals, the most teaching-intensive hospitals had an absolute change in mortality from prereform year 1 to postreform year 2 of 0.42 percentage points (4.4\% relative increase) for patients in the combined medical conditions group and 0.05 percentage points (2.3\% relative increase) for patients in the combined surgical categories group, neither of which were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The ACGME duty hour reform was not associated with either significant worsening or improvement in mortality for Medicare patients in the first 2 years after implementation.},

requirement of probability sampling. A numerical example is
examined to illustrate the dangers in the use of

apparently consonant with the sample data. The paper
concludes with a summary of principles that we believe
should guide the practitioner of sample surveys of finite

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine if the lower mortality often observed in teaching-intensive hospitals is because of lower complication rates or lower death rates after complications (failure to rescue) and whether the benefits at these hospitals accrue equally to white and black patients, since black patients receive a disproportionate share of their care at teaching-intensive hospitals. DESIGN: A retrospective study of patient outcomes and teaching intensity using logistic regression models, with and without adjusting for hospital fixed and random effects. SETTING: Three thousand two hundred seventy acute care hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS: Medicare claims on general, orthopedic, and vascular surgery admissions in the United States for 2000-2005 (N = 4,658,954 unique patients). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thirty-day mortality, in-hospital complications, and failure to rescue (the probability of death following complications). RESULTS: Combining all surgeries, compared with nonteaching hospitals, patients at very major teaching hospitals demonstrated a 15\% lower odds of death (P < .001), no difference in complications, and a 15\% lower odds of death after complications (failure to rescue) (P < .001). These relative benefits associated with higher resident-to-bed ratio were not experienced by black patients, for whom the odds of mortality and failure to rescue were similar at teaching and nonteaching hospitals, a pattern that is significantly different from that of white patients (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Survival after surgery is higher at hospitals with higher teaching intensity. Improved survival is because of lower mortality after complications (better failure to rescue) and generally not because of fewer complications. However, this better survival and failure to rescue at teaching-intensive hospitals is seen for white patients, not for black patients.},

Fisher's advice on the interpretation of observational studies was ``Make your theories elaborate''; formally, make causal theories sufficiently detailed that, under the theory, strongly ignorable assignment has testable consequences.

abstract = {In typical political experiments, researchers randomize a set of households, precincts, or individuals to treatments all at once, and characteristics of all units are known at the time of randomization. However, in many other experiments, subjects "trickle in" to be randomized to treatment conditions, usually via complete randomization. To take advantage of the rich background data that researchers often have (but underutilize) in these experiments, we develop methods that use continuous covariates to assign treatments sequentially. We build on biased coin and minimization procedures for discrete covariates and demonstrate that our methods outperform complete randomization, producing better covariate balance in simulated data. We then describe how we selected and deployed a sequential blocking method in a clinical trial and demonstrate the advantages of our having done so. Further, we show how that method would have performed in two larger sequential political trials. Finally, we compare causal effect estimates from differences in means, augmented inverse propensity weighted estimators, and randomization test inversion.},

Can descriptive comparisons meaningfully be paired with significance tests? If so, should there be several such tests, one for each pretreatment variable, or should there be a single, omnibus test? Could such a test be engineered to give easily computed p-values that are reliable in samples of moderate size, or would simulation be needed for reliable calibration? What new concerns are introduced by random assignment of clusters? Which tests of balance would be optimal? To address these questions, Fisher's randomization inference is applied to the question of balance. Its application suggests the reversal of published conclusions about two studies, one clinical and the other a field experiment in political participation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Earlier work demonstrated that ACGME duty hour reform did not adversely affect mortality, with slight improvement noted among specific subgroups. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether resident duty hour reform differentially affected the mortality risk of high severity patients or patients who experienced post-operative complications (failure-to-rescue). DESIGN: Observational study using interrupted time series analysis with data from July 1, 2000 - June 30, 2005. Fixed effects logistic regression was used to examine the change in the odds of mortality or failure-to-rescue (FTR) in more versus less teaching-intensive hospitals before and after duty hour reform. PARTICIPANTS: All unique Medicare patients (n = 8,529,595) admitted to short-term acute care non-federal hospitals and all unique VA patients (n = 318,636 patients) with principal diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, stroke or a DRG classification of general, orthopedic or vascular surgery. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured mortality within 30 days of hospital admission and FTR, measured by death among patients who experienced a surgical complication. The odds of mortality and FTR generally changed at similar rates for higher and lower risk patients in more vs. less teaching intensive hospitals. For example, comparing the mortality risk for the 10\% of Medicare patients with highest risk to the other 90\% of patients in post-reform year 1 for combined medical an OR of 1.01 [95\% CI 0.90, 1.13], for combined surgical an OR of 0.91 [95\% CI 0.80, 1.04], and for FTR an OR of 0.94 [95\% CI 0.80, 1.09]. Findings were similar in year 2 for both Medicare and VA. The two exceptions were a relative increase in mortality for the highest risk medical (OR 1.63 [95\% CI 1.08, 2.46]) and a relative decrease in the high risk surgical patients within VA in post-reform year 1 (OR 0.52 [95\% CI 0.29, 0.96]). CONCLUSIONS: ACGME duty hour reform was not associated with any consistent improvements or worsening in mortality or failure-to-rescue rates for high risk medical or surgical patients.},

@article{fraser2004aci,
abstract = {Sufficiency has long been regarded as the primary reduction procedure to simplify a statistical model, and the assessment of the procedure involves an implicit global repeated sampling principle. By contrast, conditional procedures are almost as old and yet appear only occasionally in the central statistical literature. Recent likelihood theory examines the form of a general large sample statistical model and finds that certain natural conditional procedures provide, in wide generality, the definitive reduction from the initial variable to a variable of the same dimension as the parameter, a variable that can be viewed as directly measuring the parameter. We begin with a discussion of two intriguing examples from the literature that compare conditional and global inference methods, and come quite extraordinarily to opposite assessments concerning the appropriateness and validity of the two approaches. We then take two simple normal examples, with and without known scaling, and progressively replace the restrictive normal location assumption by more general distributional assumptions. We find that sufficiency typically becomes inapplicable and that conditional procedures from large sample likelihood theory produce the definitive reduction for the analysis. We then examine the vector parameter case and find that the elimination of nuisance parameters requires a marginalization step, not the commonly proffered conditional calculation that is based on exponential model structure. Some general conditioning and modelling criteria are then introduced. This is followed by a survey of common ancillary examples, which are then assessed for conformity to the criteria. In turn, this leads to a discussion of the place for the global repeated sampling principle in statistical inference. It is argued that the principle in conjunction with various optimality criteria has been a primary factor in the long-standing attachment to the sufficiency approach and in the related neglect of the conditioning procedures based directly on available evidence.},

of randomization in experimental design. The first concerns
the computational advantages of randomizing when a
well-defined underlying theoretical model is not available,
as is often the case in much experimentation in the medical
and social sciences. The high desirability, even for the
most dedicated Bayesians, of physical randomization in some
special cases is stressed. The second line of argument
concerns communication of methodology and results,
especially in terms of concerns about bias. The third line
of argument concerns the use of randomization to guarantee
causal inferences, whether the inference consists of the
identification of a prima facie or a genuine cause. In
addition, the relation of randomization to measures of
complexity and the possibility of accepting only random
procedures that produce complex results are discussed.},

abstract = {In the simplest case-only design, cases of a disease are cross-classified into a 2 x 2 table describing a genotype attribute and exposure to some environmental agent. In some instances, the genetic attribute has described inherited genes; in other instances, it has described mutations, for instance, damage to proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes leading to cancer. Here, the population case-only odds ratio is written as a causal parameter in terms of potential outcomes with and without exposure to the agent. It is shown that the case-only odds ratio makes sense as a causal parameter with inherited genes, but its magnitude does not have a causal interpretation with mutations, although deviations from 1 do provide information. The difference is that the environmental agent certainly did not cause an individual to inherit particular genes, but it may have caused the mutation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Procedure time is a clinically important variable that is often analyzed when studying quality and efficiency. Norms for procedure length have not been reported from Medicare data sets, nor has the influence of patient and hospital characteristics on procedure time been estimated using Medicare data. METHODS: The authors obtained Medicare claims on all patients aged 65-85 years who underwent general surgical and orthopedic surgical procedures in Pennsylvania. Anesthesia procedure time was estimated from anesthesia time units bills supplied from Medicare on 20 common general and orthopedic surgery procedures, and models to determine the influence of hospital and patient characteristics were developed. RESULTS: Of the 77,638 patients, 31,472 had general surgery and 46,166 underwent orthopedic procedures. The median anesthesia time for general surgery was 133 min, and for orthopedic surgery it was 146 min. After adjusting for principal procedure, hospital, and physiologic severity, covariates associated with increased anesthesia time included: multiple procedure on same day + 18.3 min (P < 0.0001); transfer-in + 6.7 min (P = 0.0002); black race + 5.5 (P < 0.0001); coagulation disorders + 4.9 (P = 0.0012); and paraplegia + 4.5 (P = 0.0006). Lower-income black patients had significantly longer procedure times than lower-income white patients (+ 7 min; P < 0.0001). Among the 15 hospitals with the largest black surgical populations, 5 hospitals had statistically significant procedure lengths for black versus white patients, ranging from + 9 to + 16 min. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to variation by patient comorbidities and procedure, anesthesia procedure time varies with hospital, medical history, and sociodemographic characteristics.},

essential to use of the method. With scores assigned, a

computed for each table and a chi square is determined

abstract = {A comparison was carried out between the propensity score
and prognostic models in estimating treatment effects from
observational studies. One issue investigated was the
effect of estimating the propensity score on estimators of
treatment effect. It was found that estimating the
propensity score introduced no additional bias. A second
question addressed comparisons of the propensity score and
prognostic approach when a confounder is omitted. The
results indicate that biases due to omitted covariates are
large and of the same magnitude. Third, misspecifications
of the propensity score were compared to misspecified
response models. Here it was found that estimators obtained
from incorrect response models had much larger biases than
estimators from incorrectly estimated propensity scores. In
all cases there were two types of models, one involving a
continuous and one a binary response. Least squares
estimators for the continuous response were compared to
stratified mean differences between treatment groups. For
the binary response maximum likelihood estimators of the
odds ratio were compared to Mantel-Haenszel estimators. In
both cases the strata were based on the quintiles of the
true and estimated propensity scores.},

Lipsitz sums up the ways that public policy has virtually excluded communities of color from everything that American society defines as desirable: first-rate education, decent housing, asset accumulation, political power, social status, satisfying work, and even the power to shape and narrate their own history. White supremacy is no thing of the past, no fringe movement. It is a pervasive and pernicious system that restricts the political and cultural agency of African-Americans, Asian-Americans and Latinos every day. Unearned and unacknowledged, race-based advantages, not greater merit or a superior work ethic, account for white privilege. <P>Lipsitz's ultimate point is not to condemn all white people as racists but to challenge everyone to begin a principled examination of personal actions and political commitments. Exposing the system of unfairness is not enough. People of all groups-but especially white people because they benefit from that system-have to work toward eradicating the rewards of whiteness.},

Our aims are to (1) correct errors in the SCA response rate data that affected Curtin, Presser, and Singer's (2000) result, (2) examine the trend in SCA response rates after 1996, when caller identification technology became widespread, and (3) describe the roles played by the various sources of SCA nonresponse over time. The results show that the response rate decline from 1979 to 1996 was larger than described by Curtin, Presser, and Singer (2000); the response rate drop was significantly steeper from 1996 to 2003 than from 1979 to 1996; and the 1979 to 2003 trends differed substantially for refusals and noncontacts.},

Due to the success of the shareholder value movement and the widespread ``Nikefication'' of production, however, public corporations have become less concentrated, less integrated, less interconnected at the top, shorter-lived, and less prevalent since the turn of the twenty-first century, and there is reason to expect that their significance will continue to dwindle. We are left with both pathologies (heightened inequality, lower mobility, and a fragmented social safety net) and new technologies suitable for being repurposed in more democratic forms. Local solutions for producing, distributing, and sharing can provide functional alternatives to corporations for both production and employment; what is needed is the social organization to match the tools that we already have, or will have shortly. The time for democratic local economic forms prophesied by generations of activists may finally be at hand.},

abstract = {This book shows how ordinary Americans imagine their communities and the extent to which their communities' boundaries determine who they believe should benefit from the government's resources via redistributive policies. By contributing extensive empirical analyses to a largely theoretical discussion, it highlights the subjective nature of communities while confronting the elusive task of pinning down "pictures in people's heads." A deeper understanding of people's definitions of their communities and how they affect feelings of duties and obligations provides a new lens through which to look at diverse societies and the potential for both civic solidarity and humanitarian aid. This book analyzes three different types of communities and more than eight national surveys. Wong finds that the decision to help only those within certain borders and ignore the needs of those outside rests, to a certain extent, on whether and how people translate their sense of community into obligations.

Book Description
Based on analysis of three types of communities and eight national surveys, this book examines how ordinary Americans imagine their communities. Wong concludes that people's definition of their community and delineation of its boundaries shape their views on governmental redistributive policies.

This is used to estimate a model of voter turnout that controls for both absolute and relative education.

abstract = {<p>Campaigns rely upon both paid and volunteer phone calls to mobilize voters. Pastfield experiments show calls from volunteers to increase turnout and paid calls to be wholly ineffective. This article argues that the quality of phone calls rather than the presence or absence of a payroll explains this regularity. Three aspects of quality are considered: monitoring pace and interactivity, timing, and message. A fully randomized field experiment with over 100,000 subjects comparing professional and volunteer phone banks simultaneously was conducted during the 2002 congressional elections to test this hypothesis. The experiment discovers precisely the opposite relationship of prior research: effective professional phone banks and inefficient volunteer phone calls. The experiment also finds substantial temporal decay. The specific messages appear less important than tone or timing. The implications for the role of campaign consultants, replacing social capital, voter psychology, and the capacities of civic organizations are discussed.},

@article{Rosenbaum2007b,
abstract = {A small literature discusses locally most powerful rank tests when only a fraction of treated subjects respond to treatment. The ranks used in these tests are very different from conventional ranks, being relatively flat for low responses and then rising steeply, and the associated tests are much more powerful than conventional rank tests when, indeed, only a small fraction of treated subjects exhibit dramatic responses. Because the tests are derived from considerations of local power, they do not yield a plausible family of models for effect, and therefore they do not yield confidence intervals for the magnitude of effect formed by inverting the tests. There is a similarity between these tests and another family of tests, originally motivated by different considerations involving peak performance in small subsets. Exploiting this similarity, a method for obtaining confidence statements is proposed. In the case of observational studies, sensitivity to unobserved bias from nonrandom assignment of treatments is also examined. Two examples are used as illustrations: (i) a study of smoking during pregnancy and its effects on birth weight, in which smokers are matched to six controls, and (ii) a matched pair study of damage to DNA among workers at aluminum production plants.},

@article{Dupuis2005Should,
abstract = {"Coming home to eat" [Nabhan, 2002. Coming Home to Eat: The Pleasures and Politics of Local Foods. Norton, New York] has become a clarion call among alternative food movement activists. Most food activist discourse makes a strong connection between the localization of food systems and the promotion of environmental sustainability and social justice. Much of the US academic literature on food systems echoes food activist rhetoric about alternative food systems as built on alternative social norms. New ways of thinking, the ethic of care, desire, realization, and vision become the explanatory factors in the creation of alternative food systems. In these norm-based explanations, the "Local" becomes the context in which this type of action works. In the European food system literature about local "value chains" and alternative food networks, localism becomes a way to maintain rural livelihoods. In both the US and European literatures on localism, the global becomes the universal logic of capitalism and the local the point of resistance to this global logic, a place where "embeddedness" can and does happen. Nevertheless, as other literatures outside of food studies show, the local is often a site of inequality and hegemonic domination. However, rather than declaim the "radical particularism" of localism, it is more productive to question an "unreflexive localism" and to forge localist alliances that pay attention to equality and social justice. The paper explores what that kind of localist politics might look like.},

abstract = {Our first purpose was to determine whether, in the context of a group-randomized trial (GRT) with Gaussian errors, permutation or mixed-model regression methods fare better in the presence of measurable confounding in terms of their Monte Carlo type I error rates and power. Our results indicate that given a proper randomization, the type I error rate is similar for both methods, whether unadjusted or adjusted, even in small studies. However, our results also show that should the investigator face the unfortunate circumstance in which modest confounding exists in the only realization available, the unadjusted analysis risks a type I error; in this regard, there was little to distinguish the two methods. Finally, our results show that power is similar for the two methods and, not surprisingly, better for the adjusted tests.Our second purpose was to examine the relative performance of permutation and mixed-model regression methods in the context of a GRT when the normality assumptions underlying the mixed model are violated. Published studies have examined the impact of violation of this assumption at the member level only. Our findings indicate that both methods perform well when the assumption is violated so long as the ICC is very small and the design is balanced at the group level. However, at ICC?0.01, the permutation test carries the nominal type I error rate while the model-based test is conservative and so less powerful. Binomial group- and member-level errors did not otherwise change the relative performance of the two methods with regard to confounding.},

Co-optation theory conceptualizes the commercial marketplace as an ideological force that assimilates the symbols and practices of a counterculture into dominant norms. Our alternative argument is that co-optation can generate a countervailing market response that actively promotes the oppositional aspects of a counterculture attenuated by the process of commercial mainstreaming. To develop this theoretical argument, we analyze community-supported agriculture, which has emerged in response to the corporate co-optation of the organic food movement. We conclude by discussing how tacit political ideologies structure consumption communities.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, striking examples of allegedly inferior likelihood ratio tests (LRT) have appeared in the statistical literature. These examples, which arise in multiparameter hypothesis testing problems, have several common features. In each case the null hypothesis is composite, the size $\alpha$ LRT is not similar and hence biased, and competing size $\alpha$ tests can be constructed that are less biased, or even unbiased, and that dominate the LRT in the sense of being everywhere more powerful. It is therefore asserted that in these examples and, by implication, many other testing problems, the LR criterion produces "inferior," "deficient," "undesirable," or "flawed" statistical procedures. This message, which appears to be proliferating, is wrong. In each example it is the allegedly superior test that is flawed, not the LRT. At worst, the "superior" tests provide unwarranted and inappropriate inferences and have been deemed scientifically unacceptable by applied statisticians. This reinforces the well-documented but oft-neglected fact that the Neyman-Pearson theory desideratum of a more (or most) powerful size $\alpha$ test may be scientifically inappropriate; the same is true for the criteria of unbiasedness and $\alpha$-admissibility. Although the LR criterion is not infallible, we believe that it remains a generally reasonable first option for non-Bayesian parametric hypothesis-testing problems.},

abstract = {We use longitudinal data incorporating three generations of Americans to reevaluate the character and consequences of political socialization within the family. Findings about parental influence based on youth coming of age in the 1990s strongly parallel those based on youth socialized in the 1960s. As expected on the basis of social learning theory, children are more likely to adopt their parents' political orientations if the family is highly politicized and if the parents provide consistent cues over time. The direct transmission model is robust, as it withstands an extensive set of controls. Early acquisition of parental characteristics influences the subsequent nature of adult political development.},

abstract = {In many applications of instrumental-variables regression, researchers seek to defend the plausibility of a key assumption: the instrumental variable is independent of the error term in a linear regression model. Although fulfilling this exogeneity criterion is necessary for a valid application of the instrumental-variables approach, it is not sufficient. In the regression context, the identification of causal effects depends not just on the exogeneity of the in- strument but also on the validity of the underlying model. In this article, I focus on one feature of such models: the assumption that variation in the endogenous regressor that is related to the instrumental variable has the same effect as variation that is unrelated to the instrument. In many applications, this assumption may be quite strong, but relaxing it can limit our ability to estimate parameters of interest. After discussing two substantive exam- ples, I develop analytic results (simulations are reported elsewhere). I also present a spec- ification test that may be useful for determining the relevance of these issues in a given application},

@article{Polsky2006,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigates geographic variation in chemotherapy utilization for ovarian cancer in both absolute and relative terms and examines area characteristics associated with this variation. DATA SOURCES: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare data from 1990 to 2001 for Medicare patients over 65 with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer between 1990 and 1999. Chemotherapy within a year of diagnosis was identified by Medicare billing codes. The hospital referral region (HRR) represents the geographic unit of analysis. STUDY DESIGN: A logit model predicting the probability of receiving chemotherapy by each of the 39 HRRs. Control variables included medical characteristics (patient age, stage, year of diagnosis, and comorbidities) and socioeconomic characteristics (race, income, and education). The variation among HRRs was tested by the chi2 statistic, and the relative contribution was measured by the omega statistic. HHR market characteristic are then used to explain HRR-level variation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The average chemotherapy rate was 56.6 percent, with a range by HRR from 33 percent to 67 percent. There were large and significant differences in chemotherapy use between HRRs, reflected by a chi2 for HRR of 146 (df = 38, p < .001). HRR-level variation in chemotherapy use can be partially explained by higher chemotherapy rates in HRRs with a higher percentage of hospitals with oncology services. However, an omega analysis indicates that, by about 15 to one, the variation between patients in use of chemotherapy reflects variations in patient characteristics rather than unexplained variation among HRRs. CONCLUSIONS: While absolute levels of chemotherapy variation between geographic areas are large and statistically significant, this analysis suggests that the role of geography in determining who gets chemotherapy is small relative to individual medical characteristics. Nevertheless, while variation by medical characteristics can be medically justified, the same cannot be said for geographic variation. Our finding that density of oncology hospitals predicts chemotherapy use suggests that provider supply is positively correlated with geographic variation.},

abstract = {School-effects research in sociology cannot be separated
from concerns about causality. Purely descriptive modeling
justifications are untenable. Focusing on the Catholic
school effect on learning, this article demonstrates an
approach that places regression modeling strategies within
a specific and well-developed framework for thinking about
causality. While regression models should properly remain
the workhorse methodology for school-effects research,
regression estimates should more often be subject to
exacting interpretations and presented alongside
alternative estimates of more specific parameters of
interest. In this demonstration, propensity- score matching
estimates of the Catholic school effect for the Catholic
schooled are provided to supplement the estimates obtained
by regression models. Although subject to their own set of
weaknesses, the matching estimates suggest that the
Catholic school effect is the strongest among those
Catholic school students who, according to their observed
characteristics, are least likely to attend Catholic
schools. Four alternative explanations are offered for this
finding, each of which should be pursued in further
research.},

abstract = {It is often said that an important consideration in judging whether an association between treatment and response is causal is the presence or absence of a dose-response relationship, that is, larger ostensible treatment effects when doses of treatment are larger. This criterion is widely discussed in textbooks and is often mentioned in empirical papers. At the same time, it is well known through both important examples and elementary theory that a treatment may cause dramatic effects with no dose-response relationship, and hidden biases may produce a dose-response relationship when the treatment is without effect. What does a dose-response relationship say about causality? It is observed here that a dose-response relationship may or may not reduce sensitivity to hidden bias, and whether it has or has not can be determined by a suitable analysis using the data at hand. Moreover, a study without a dose-response relationship may or may not be less sensitive to hidden bias than another study with such a relationship, and this, too, can be determined from the data at hand. An example concerning cytogenetic damage among professional painters is used to illustrate.},

Although the assumption of no interference is often necessary for causal inference, few options are available for testing this assumption. This article presents an ex post method for detecting interference between units in randomized experiments. With a test statistic of the analyst's choice, a conditional randomization test allows for the calculation of the exact significance level of the causal dependence of outcomes on the treatment status of other units. The robustness of the method is demonstrated through simulation studies. Moreover, using this method, interference between units is detected in a field experiment designed to assess the effect of mailings on voter turnout in a U.S. primary election.},

Currently, matched samples are constructed using greedy heuristics (or" stepwise" procedures) that produce, in general, suboptimal matchings. With respect to a particualr criterion, a matched sample is suboptimal if it could be improved by changing the controls assigned to specific treated units, that is, if it could be improved with the data at hand. Here, optimal matched samples are obtained using network flow theory. In addition to providing optimal matched-pair samples, this approach yields optimal constructions for several statistical matching problems that have not been studied previously, including the construction of matched samples with multiple controls, with a variable number of controls, and the construction of balanced matched samples that combine features of pair matching and frequency matching. Computational efficiency is discussed. Extensive use is made of ideas from two essentially disjoint literatures, namely statistical matching in observational studies and graph algorithms for matching. The article contains brief reviews of both topics.},

abstract = {What has always bothered me about the ``experimentalist'' school is the false sense of certainty it conveys. My view, like Leamer's, is that there is no way to escape the role of assumptions in statistical work, so our conclusions will always be contingent. Hence, we should be circumspect about our degree of knowledge. I present some lessons for economics from the field of marketing, a field where broad consensus has been reached on many key issues over the past twenty years. In marketing, 1) the structural paradigm is dominant, 2) the data are a lot better than in some fields of economics, and 3) there is great emphasis on external validation. Of course, good data always helps. I emphasize that the ability to do controlled experiments does not obviate the need for theory, and finally I address different approaches to model validation.

Working with collaborators, I have developed each of these initiatives at book length. This essay suggests how the ``citizenship agenda'' yields a whole that is larger than the sum of its parts.},

Political consumerism is turning the market into a site for politics and ethics, as consumer choices reflect personal attitudes and purchases are informed by ethical or political assessment of business and government practice. In such forms as boycotts, when consumers refuse to buy, or buycotts, where consumers shift their purchases, the ostensibly apolitical marketplace is a site of contestation at the intersection of globalization and individualization. This book opens readers' eyes to a new way of viewing everyday consumer choices and the role of the market in our lives, illuminating the broader theoretical and historical context of concerns about sweatshops, responsible coffee, and ethical and free trade.},

@article{Free:1999,
abstract = {The \{"\}numerical method\{"\} in medicine goes back to Pierre
Louis' 1835 study of pneumonia and John Snow's 1855 book on
the epidemiology of cholera. Snow took advantage of natural
experiments and used convergent lines of evidence to
demonstrate that cholera is a waterborne infectious
disease. More recently, investigators in the social and
life sciences have used statistical models and significance
tests to deduce cause-and-effect relationships from
patterns of association; an early example is Yule's 1899
study on the causes of poverty. In my view, this modeling
enterprise has not been successful. Investigators tend to
neglect the difficulties in establishing causal relations,
and the mathematical complexities obscure rather than
clarify the assumptions on which the analysis is based.
Formal statistical inference is, by its nature,
conditional. If maintained hypotheses A, B, C,... hold,
then H can be tested against the data. However, if A, B,
C,... remain in doubt, so must inferences about H. Careful
scrutiny of maintained hypotheses should therefore be a
critical part of empirical work-a principle honored more
often in the breach than the observance. Snow's work on
cholera will be contrasted with modern studies that depend
on statistical models and tests of significance. The
examples may help to clarify the limits of current
statistical techniques for making causal inferences from
patterns of association.},

@article{Rosenbaum2009b,
abstract = {In randomized experiments, it is sometimes important to demonstrate that two treatments do not differ greatly in their effects, or to demonstrate that the treatments have very different effects on one outcome similar effects on another outcome. These "demonstrations" may take the form of rejecting a null hypothesis of inequivalence in an equivalence test, or rejecting a null hypothesis of equal and inequivalent effects on two outcomes. The procedures often express a complex hypothesis in terms of component hypotheses, and combine the component significance levels to test the complex hypothesis. If used in a randomized trial, randomization provides valid significance levels for each component test, and hence also for the combined procedure. In an observational study-that is, in a study of treatments that were not randomly assigned-there is typically concern that significance levels for testing hypotheses about treatment effects may be distorted by failure to control for some unobserved pretreatment covariate. This concern is raised in the evaluation of virtually all observational studies. The possible impact of such an unobserved covariate is clarified and displayed by a sensitivity analysis that, for various possible magnitudes of potential bias. yields a corresponding interval of possible significance levels. Some observational studies are sensitive to very small unobserved biases, whereas others are insensitive to large biases. Here, existing sensitivity analyses for component hypotheses are used to generate sensitivity analyses for complex hypotheses tested by combining component significance levels. We apply the procedure to our study of the timing of discharges of premature babies from neonatal intensive care units, focusing on the possible impact of delayed discharge on use of unplanned medical care after discharge.},

abstract = {Finite population sampling is perhaps the only area of statistics in which the primary mode of analysis is based on the randomization distribution, rather than on statistical models for the measured variables. This article reviews the debate between design-based and model-based inference. The basic features of the two approaches are illustrated using the case of inference about the mean from stratified random samples. Strengths and weakness of design-based and model-based inference for surveys are discussed. It is suggested that models that take into account the sample design and make weak parametric assumptions can produce reliable and efficient inferences in surveys settings. These ideas are illustrated using the problem of inference from unequal probability samples. A model-based regression analysis that leads to a combination of design-based and model-based weighting is described. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In this article, we borrow from Parsons and Shils to offer a conceptualization of context. This conceptualization, and a recognition of both Lippmann's pseduoenvironments and the statistical Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, lead us to a new measurement strategy. We propose a map-based measure to capture how ordinary people use information about their environments to make decisions about politics. Respondents draw their contexts on maps--deciding the boundaries of their relevant environments--and describe their perceptions of hte demographic make-up of these contexts. The evidence is clear: `pictures in our heads' do not resemble governmental administrative units in shape or content. By `bringing the person back in' to the measurement of context, we are able to marry psychological theories of information processing with sociological theories of racial threat.},

abstract = {Propensity score matching provides an estimate of the effect of a ‘‘treatment’’ variable on an outcome variable that is largely free of bias arising from an association between treatment status and observable variables. However, matching methods are not robust against ‘‘hidden bias’’ arising from unobserved variables that simultaneously affect assignment to treatment and the outcome variable. One strategy for addressing this problem is the Rosenbaum bounds approach, which allows the analyst to determine howstrongly an unmeasured confounding variable must affect selection into treatment in order to undermine the conclusions about causal effects from a matching analysis. Instrumental variables (IV) estimation provides an alternative strategy for the estimation of causal effects, but themethod typically reduces the precision of the estimate and has an additional source of uncertainty that derives from the untestable nature of the assumptions of the IV approach. A method of assessing this additional uncertainty is proposed so that the total uncertainty of the IVapproach can be compared with the Rosenbaumbounds approach to uncertainty using matching methods. Because the approaches rely on different information and different assump- tions, they provide complementary information about causal relationships. The approach is illustrated via an analysis of the impact of unemployment insurance on the timing of reemploy- ment, the postunemployment wage, and the probability of relo- cation, using data from several panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).},

We study the distribution of the adaptive LASSO estimator [Zou, H., 2006. The adaptive LASSO and its oracle properties. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101, 1418-1429] in finite samples as well as in the large-sample limit. The large-sample distributions are derived both for the case where the adaptive LASSO estimator is tuned to perform conservative model selection as well as for the case where the tuning results in consistent model selection. We show that the finite-sample as well as the large-sample distributions are typically highly nonnormal, regardless of the choice of the tuning parameter. The uniform convergence rate is also obtained, and is shown to be slower than n-1/2 in case the estimator is tuned to perform consistent model selection. In particular, these results question the statistical relevance of the [`]oracle' property of the adaptive LASSO estimator established in Zou [2006. The adaptive LASSO and its oracle properties. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101, 1418-1429]. Moreover, we also provide an impossibility result regarding the estimation of the distribution function of the adaptive LASSO estimator. The theoretical results, which are obtained for a regression model with orthogonal design, are complemented by a Monte Carlo study using nonorthogonal regressors.},

@misc{Rosenbaum2009a,
abstract = {A sensitivity analysis displays the increase in uncertainty that attends an inference when a key assumption is relaxed. In matched observational studies of treatment effects, a key assumption in some analyses is that subjects matched for observed covariates are comparable, and this assumption is relaxed by positing a relevant covariate that was not observed and not controlled by matching. What properties would such an unobserved covariate need to have to materially alter the inference about treatment effects? For ease of calculation and reporting, it is convenient that the sensitivity analysis be of low dimension, perhaps indexed by a scalar sensitivity parameter, but for interpretation in specific contexts, a higher dimensional analysis may be of greater relevance. An amplification of a sensitivity analysis is defined as a map from each point in a low dimensional sensitivity analysis to a set of points, perhaps a 'curve,' in a higher dimensional sensitivity analysis such that the possible inferences are the same for all points in the set. Possessing an amplification, an investigator may calculate and report the low dimensional analysis, yet have available the interpretations of the higher dimensional analysis.},

Also discussed is a sensitivity analysis for case-control studies that have two distinct types of controls, say hospital and neighborhood controls, where the two types may be affected by different biases. For illustration, the method is applied to five case-control studies, including a study of herniated lumbar disc in which there are three types of cases, and a study of breast cancer with two types of controls.},

two distinct problems of statistical inference. First,
because the data constitute all the available observations

appropriate. Second, the small and collinear data sets of
comparative research yield imprecise estimates of the

The trajectory groups also aid in characterizing classes of subjects for whom no good matches are available and to define substantively interesting groups between which treatment effects may vary. These and related methods are illustrated using data from a Montreal-based study. The effects on subsequent violence of gang joining at age 14 are studied while controlling for measured characteristics of boys prior to age 14. The boys are divided into trajectory groups based on violence from ages 11 to 13. Within trajectory group, joiners are optimally matched to a variable number of controls using propensity scores, Mahalanobis distances, and a combinatorial optimization algorithm. Use of variable ratio matching results in greater efficiency than pair matching and also greater bias reduction than matching at a fixed ratio. The possible impact of failing to adjust for an important but unmeasured covariate is examined using sensitivity analysis.},

abstract = {In randomisation and permutation inference, pivotal arguments remove the hypoth- esised treatment effect, thereby basing inferences on the null distribution in which the treatment has no effect. This is common, for instance, with additive treatment effects. The current paper uses 'attributable effects' to expand substantially the scope of pivotal argu- ments. Attributable effects are defined for three cases, namely the 2 x 2 contingency table, displacement effects and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistic, and in each case removing an appropriate attributable effect restores the familiar null randomisation distribution of the associated statistic, yielding exact inferences. The procedure extends immediately for use in sensitivity analysis in nonrandomised observational studies.},

abstract = {Two issues are discussed in this paper. The first is
whether a formal definition and justification of simplicity
(parsimony) in scientific inference can be found, and
whether an optimal level of simplicity is obtainable. A
definition of simplicity is possible, as are the optimum
conditions for the desired degree of simplicity. The model
of inference used here relates Bayesian inference to
algorithmic information theory. Simplicity is examined in
the light of induction, the Duhem-Quine thesis, and bounded
rationality. The second issue relates to the role that
simplicity might play in econometric modelling. This is
elucidated with some remarks on the `general to specific'
approach to modelling and discussions on the purpose of a
model.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is usually administered by medical oncologists (MOs) or gynecologic oncologists (GOs). GOs perform a broad spectrum of surgical and medical activities while managing a limited number of diseases; MOs specialize in the administration of chemotherapy but manage a broad array of diseases. We asked whether survival, treatment, and toxicity differed according to the type of specialist providing the chemotherapy after surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)--Medicare data for patients 65 years old from 1991 through 2001 from eight SEER sites, we identified 344 patients with ovarian cancer who were treated with chemotherapy by a GO after surgery. Using optimal matching and propensity scores based on 36 characteristics, we matched these patients to 344 similar patients who were operated on and staged by the same type of surgeon but who received chemotherapy from an MO. RESULTS: MOs administered chemotherapy over more weeks than did the GOs (16.5 v 12.1 weeks, respectively; P < .0023), and MO patients had substantially more weeks that included chemotherapy-associated adverse events than GO patients (16.2 v 8.9 weeks, respectively; P < .0001). However, there was no difference in 5-year survival rate between the GO and MO groups (35\% v 34\%, respectively; P = .45). CONCLUSION: GO- and MO-treated patients who were closely matched on prognostic characteristics experienced very different rates of chemotherapy-associated adverse events and very different chemotherapy treatment styles by specialty type; however, their survival was virtually identical.},

It is a vehicle for generational moods and aspirations, a public refuge for fantasies outlawed in daily life, a testing ground for technical ingenuity, an enormously profitable commercial channel for mainstream narratives of thought and behavior, and one of the corporate state's main theatres for national moral panic. Today's sounds, and the debates about their various forms, are inseparable from the social conditions of the last two decades: class polarization, racial marginalization, and economic violence enacted to a degree that has left youth, as a whole, with drastically reduced opportunities in life. Youth culture is still responding to these uneven developments with a passion that has been romanticized by some critics as a significant form of resistance, and denigrated by others as an avoidance of direct and political protest.<br><br><b></b><b><i>Microphone Fiends</i></b><b></b>, a collection of original essays and interviews, brings together some of the best known scholars, critics, journalists and performers to focus on the contemporary scene. It includes theoretical discussions of musical history along with social commentaries about genres like disco, metal and rap music, and case histories of specific movements like the Riot Grrls, funk clubbing in Rio de Janeiro, and the British rave scene. The contents of the volume engage with the broad tradition of cultural studies and sociology of youth music and culture, but they are also designed to address audiences reached by mainstream music journalism and fans of any musical taste.},

abstract = {This article examines some problems of significance testing for one-sided hypotheses of the form H0: \{\^{I}\}¸ \{\^{a}\} \{\^{I}\}¸0 versus H\_1: $\theta$> $\theta$\_0 , where \{\^{I}\}¸ is the parameter of interest. In the usual setting, let x be the observed data and let T(X) be a test statistic such that the family of distributions of T(X) is stochastically increasing in \{\^{I}\}¸. Define Cx as \{X: T(X) - T(x) \{\^{a}\} 0\}. The p value is p(x) = $\backslash$sup\_\{$\theta$$\backslash$leq $\theta$\_0\} $\backslash$Pr(X $\backslash$in C\_x $\backslash$mid $\theta$) . In the presence of a nuisance parameter \{\^{I}\}·, there may not exist a nontrivial Cx with a p value independent of \{\^{I}\}·. We consider tests based on generalized extreme regions of the form Cx(\{\^{I}\}¸, \{\^{I}\}·) = \{X: T(X; x, \{\^{I}\}¸, \{\^{I}\}·) \{\^{a}\} T(x; x, \{\^{I}\}¸, \{\^{I}\}·)\}, and conditions on T(X, x, \{\^{I}\}¸, \{\^{I}\}·) are given such that the p value p(x) = $\backslash$sup\_\{$\theta$$\backslash$leq $\theta$\_0\} Pr(X $\backslash$in C\_x $\backslash$mid $\theta$) is free of the nuisance parameter \{\^{I}\}·, where T is stochastically increasing in \{\^{I}\}¸. We provide a solution to the problem of testing hypotheses about the differences in means of two independent exponential distributions, a problem for which the fixed-level testing approach has not produced a nontrivial solution except in a special case. We also provide an exact solution to the Behrens-Fisher problem. The p value for the Behrens-Fisher problem turns out to be numerically (but not logically) the same as Jeffreys's Bayesian solution and the Behrens-Fisher fiducial solution. Our approach of testing on the basis of p values is especially useful in multiparameter problems where nontrivial tests with a fixed level of significance are difficult or impossible to obtain.},

abstract = {An observational study is an attempt to estimate the effects of a treatment when subjects are not randomly assigned to treatment or control. The possibility of using more than one control group has often been briefly mentioned in general discussions of observational studies, and many observational studies have used two control groups. Here, the limited and dispersed literature on this subject is reviewed, and the topic is developed in several directions by using a formal notation for observational studies. The value of a second control group depends on the supplementary information that is available about unobserved biases that are suspected to exist. A second control group provides a test of the assumption that conventional adjustments for observed covariates suffice in estimating treatment effects. Under the best of circumstances, this test is consistent and unbiased, and its power exceeds the probability of falsely detecting a treatment effect. Indeed, under the best of circumstances, two control groups can yield consistent and unbiased estimates of bounds on the treatment effect when conventional adjustments fail. In contrast, however, in the worst of circumstances, a second control group can be of little value.},

Roughly speaking, we know the number of successes for two proportions, treated and control, but not the numbers of trials or units for these proportions; indeed, the concept of a "trial" may be somewhat vague. With no further information, the situation is quite hopeless. However, an interesting strategy that is sometimes used entails identifying two types of cases whose origin is entirely different so that it is known the cases of the second type were definitely not affected by the treatment under study. This strategy--the case-case or case2-study--seems to have been reinvented independently many times, and has recently been offered as a general strategy for infectious disease epidemiology by McCarthy and Giesecke (1999, International Journal of Epidemiology 28, 764-768). Can this strategy permit estimation of the number of cases caused by the treatment? Using attributable effects in a new way, a method of exact inference is proposed, along with a large sample approximation. Two examples are discussed: one concerning the effects of daytime running lights (DRLs) on the risk of multivehicle accidents; the other concerning the origin of a Salmonella infection. A counterexample with superficially similar appearance is also discussed concerning suicide rates following the publication of Final Exit; here, the treatment may alter the outcome, or it may alter the type, and the attributable effect cannot be estimated.},

assignment to a particular treatment given a vector of
observed covariates. Previous theoretical arguments have
shown that subclassification on the propensity score will
balance all observed covariates. Subclassification on an
estimated propensity score is illustrated, using
observational data on treatments for coronary artery
disease. Five subclasses defined by the estimated
propensity score are constructed that balance 74
covariates, and thereby provide estimates of treatment
effects using direct adjustment. These subclasses are
applied within subpopulations, and model-based adjustments
are then used to provide estimates of treatment effects
within these subpopulations. Two appendixes address
theoretical issues related to the application: the
effectiveness of subclassification on the propensity score
in removing bias, and balancing properties of propensity
scores with incomplete data.},

These matched samples displayed little to no differences across hospitals in common patient characteristics yet found large and statistically significant hospital variation in mortality, complications, failure-to-rescue, readmissions, length of stay, ICU days, cost, and surgical procedure length. Similar patients at different hospitals had substantially different outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The template-matched sample can produce fair, directly standardized audits that evaluate hospitals on patients with similar characteristics, thereby making benchmarking more believable. Through examining matched samples of individual patients, administrators can better detect poor performance at their hospitals and better understand why these problems are occurring.},

abstract = {'As ye randomise so shall ye analyse', is one way of describing Fisher's defence of randomization. Yet, when it comes to clinical trials we nearly always randomize but we rarely analyse the way we randomize and Fisher himself was no exception. Two controversies involving Fisher in the 1930s are discussed: one with Neyman concerning additivity and the other with Student concerning randomization. Their relevance today is considered, as is whether randomization inference in clinical trials is dead and whether modelling rules the day, whether minimization is an acceptable procedure and to what extent trialists confuse experiments with surveys. It will be maintained that a number of different possible purposes of clinical trials have been confused because in the case of the general linear model, under strong additivity, they can all be satisfied by a single analysis. More generally, however, this is not the case.},

A previous paper (Rosenbaum, 1987a) proposed a method for displaying the sensitivity of permutation inferences to bias due to an unobserved covariate in two cases: (i) the case of matched pairs, with arbitrary response variables, and (ii) the case of matching with multiple controls in the special case of binary responses. The current note shows that an analogous argument applies in the case of matching with multiple controls with arbitrary responses, providing the test statistic used is a member of a certain family of generalizations of Wilcoxon's signed-rank statistic, a family that includes methods for binary and censored data.},

@book{Butler1990Gender,
abstract = {\{In a new introduction to the 10th-anniversary edition of <I>Gender Trouble</I>--among the two or three most influential books (and by far the most popular) in the field of gender studies--Judith Butler explains the complicated critical response to her groundbreaking arguments and the ways her ideas have evolved as a result. Nevertheless, she has resisted the urge to revise what has become a feminist classic (as well as an elegant defense of drag, given Butler's emphasis on the performative nature of gender). The book was produced, according to Butler, "as part of the cultural life of a collective struggle that has had, and will continue to have, some success in increasing the possibilities for a livable life for those who live, or try to live, on the sexual margins." An attack on the essentialism of French feminist theory and its basis in structuralist anthropology, <I>Gender Trouble</I> expands to address the cultural prejudices at play in genetic studies of sex determination, as well as the uses of gender parody, and also provides a critical genealogy of the naturalization of sex. A primer in gender studies--and sexy reading for college caf\'{e}s. <I>--Regina Marler</I> \} \{Since its publication in 1990, <i>Gender Trouble</i> has become one of the key works of contemporary feminist theory, and an essential work for anyone interested in the study of gender, queer theory, or the politics of sexuality in culture. This is the text where Judith Butler began to advance the ideas that would go on to take life as "performativity theory," as well as some of the first articulations of the possibility for subversive gender practices, and she writes in her preface to the 10th anniversary edition released in 1999 that one point of <i>Gender Trouble</i> was "not to prescribe a new gendered way of life [...] but to open up the field of possibility for gender [...]" Widely taught, and widely debated, <i>Gender Trouble</i> continues to offer a powerful critique of heteronormativity and of the function of gender in the modern world.\} \{In this highly-acclaimed subversive book, Butler examines the `trouble' with unproblematized appeals to sex/gender identities. A seminal text for gender studies.\}},

abstract = {Angrist and Pischke highlight one aspect of the research that has positively transformed econometric practice and teaching. They emphasize the rise of experiments and quasi-experiments as credible sources of identification in microeconometric studies, which they usefully term ``design-based research.'' But in so doing, they miss an important part of the story: a second research strand aimed at developing tools for inference that are robust to subsidiary modeling assumptions. My first aim in these remarks therefore is to highlight some key developments in this area. I then turn to Angrist and Pischke's call for adopting experiments and quasi-experiments in macroeconometrics; while sympathetic, I suspect the scope for such studies is limited. I conclude with some observations on the current debate about whether experimental methods have gone too far in abandoning economic theory. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Findings about parental influence based on youth coming of age in the 1990s strongly parallel those based on youth socialized in the 1960s. As expected on the basis of social learning theory, children are more likely to adopt their parents political orientations if the family is highly politicized and if the parents provide consistent cues over time. The direct transmission model is robust, as it withstands an extensive set of controls. Early acquisition of parental characteristics influences the subsequent nature of adult political development.},

abstract = {In the portion of the paper translated here, Neyman
introduces a model for the analysis of field experiments
conducted for the purpose of comparing a number of crop
varieties, which makes use of a double-indexed array of
unknown potential yields, one index corresponding to
varieties and the other to plots. The yield corresponding
to only one variety will be observed on any given plot, but
through an urn model embodying sampling without replacement
from this doubly indexed array, Neyman obtains a formula
for the variance of the difference between the averages of
the observed yields of two varieties. This variance
involves the variance over all plots of the potential
yields and the correlation coefficient r between the
potential yields of the two varieties on the same plot.
Since it is impossible to estimate r directly, Neyman
advises taking r = 1, observing that in practice this may
lead to using too large an estimated standard deviation,
when comparing two variety means.},

abstract = {In empirical analysis of data consisting of repeated
observations on economic units (time series on a cross
section) it is often assumed that the coefficients of the
quantitative variables (slopes) are the same, whereas the
coefficients of the qualitative variables (intercepts or
effects) vary over units or periods.This is the
constant-slope variable-intercept framework. In such an
analysis an explicit account should be taken of the
statistical dependence that exists between the quantitative
variables and the effects. It is shown that when this is
done, the random effect approach and the fixed effect
approach yield the same estimate for the slopes, the
\{"\}within\{"\} estimate. Any matrix combination of the
\{"\}within\{"\} and \{"\}between\{"\} estimates is generally
biased. When the \{"\}within\{"\} estimate is subject to a
relatively large error a minimum mean square error can be
applied, as is generally done in regression analysis. Such
an estimator is developed here from a somewhat different
point of departure.},

@techreport{martinez2009lasso,
abstract = {When employing model selection methods such as the Lasso and the Adaptive Lasso, it is typical to estimate the smoothing parameter by m-fold crossvalidation, e.g., m = 10. In problems where the true regression function is sparse and the signals large, such crossvali- dation typically works well, with the Adaptive Lasso being an oracle method. However, in regression modeling of genomic studies involving Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), the true regression functions, while thought to be sparse, do not have large signals. We demonstrate empirically that in such problems, the number of selected variables using the Adaptive Lasso with 10-fold crossvalidation is a random variable that has considerable and surprising variation. Similar remarks apply to the Lasso. Our study strongly questions the suitability of performing only a single run of m-fold crossvalidation with any oracle method,
and not just the Adaptive Lasso.},

abstract = {In 1994 the School of Medicine of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, its clinical teachers, and the three principal teaching hospitals initiated a new approach to funding, the Alternative Funding Plan, a pragmatic response to the inability of fee-for-service billing by clinical faculty to subsidize the academic mission of the health sciences center. The center was funded to provide a package of service and academic deliverables (outputs), rather than on the basis of payment for physician clinical activity (inputs). The new plan required a new governance structure representing stakeholders and raised a number of important issues: how to reconcile the preservation of physician professional autonomy with corporate responsibilities; how to gather requisite information so as to equitably allocate resources; and how to report to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care in order to demonstrate accountability. In subsequent iterations of the agreement it was necessary to address issues of flexibility resulting from locked-in funding levels and to devise meaningful performance measures for departments and the center as a whole. The authors conclude that the Alternative Funding Plan represents a successful innovation in funding for an academic health sciences center in that it has created financial stability, as well as modest positive effects for education and research. The Ontario government hopes to replicate the model at the province's other four health sciences centers, and it may have applicability in any jurisdiction in which the costs of medical education outstrip the capacity of faculty clinical earnings.},

abstract = {When leaders and citizens in the United States articulate their core political beliefs, they often do so in terms of parenthood and family. But while the motives might be admirable, the results of such thinking are often corrosive to our democratic goals. In The Parent as Citizen, Brian Duff reveals how efforts to make the experience of parenthood inform citizenship contribute to the most persistent problems in modern democracy and democratic theory.
Duff explains how influential theories of democratic citizenship rely on the metaphor of parenthood to help individuals rise to the challenges of politics, and demonstrates that this reliance has unintended consequences. When parenthood is imagined to instill confidence in political virtue, it uncovers insecurity. When parenthood is believed to inculcate openness to change, it produces fundamentalism. Duff develops this argument through original readings of four theorists of citizenship: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Rorty, and Cornel West-readings that engage the ways in which these theorists incorporated their personal history into their political thought.
In showing how problems that plagued canonical theorists of citizenship still trouble contemporary thinkers and citizens alike, Duff's insights are deeply relevant to present-day politics.},

Disentangling and isolating the unique effects of peer behavior, selection processes, and congruent interests is a challenge for all studies of interpersonal influence. This study proposes and utilizes a carefully designed placebo-controlled experimental protocol to overcome this identification problem.During a face-to-face canvassing experiment targeting households with two registered voters, residents who answered the door were exposed to either a Get Out the Vote message (treatment) or a recycling pitch (placebo). The turnout of the person in the household not answering the door allows for contagion to be measured. Both experiments find that 60\% of the propensity to vote is passed onto the other member of the household. This finding suggests a mechanism by which civic participation norms are adopted and couples grow more similar over time.},

In randomised experiments, the differential effect is of no more or less interest than other treatment contrasts. Differential effects play a special role in certain observational studies in which treatments are not assigned to subjects at random, where differing outcomes may reflect biased assignments rather than effects caused by the treatments. Differential effects are immune to certain types of unobserved bias, called generic biases, which are associated with both treatments in a similar way. This is explored using several examples and models. Differential effects are not immune to differential biases, whose possible consequences are examined by sensitivity analysis.},

abstract = {Multiplicative interaction models are common in the quantitative political science literature. This is so for good reason. Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10\% of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},

@article{Greevy2004,
abstract = {Although blocking or pairing before randomization is a basic principle of experimental design, the principle is almost invariably applied to at most one or two blocking variables. Here, we discuss the use of optimal multivariate matching prior to randomization to improve covariate balance for many variables at the same time, presenting an algorithm and a case-study of its performance. The method is useful when all subjects, or large groups of subjects, are randomized at the same time. Optimal matching divides a single group of 2n subjects into n pairs to minimize covariate differences within pairs-the so-called nonbipartite matching problem-then one subject in each pair is picked at random for treatment, the other being assigned to control. Using the baseline covariate data for 132 patients from an actual, unmatched, randomized experiment, we construct 66 pairs matching for 14 covariates. We then create 10000 unmatched and 10000 matched randomized experiments by repeatedly randomizing the 132 patients, and compare the covariate balance with and without matching. By every measure, every one of the 14 covariates was substantially better balanced when randomization was performed within matched pairs. Even after covariance adjustment for chance imbalances in the 14 covariates, matched randomizations provided more accurate estimates than unmatched randomizations, the increase in accuracy being equivalent to, on average, a 7\% increase in sample size. In randomization tests of no treatment effect, matched randomizations using the signed rank test had substantially higher power than unmatched randomizations using the rank sum test, even when only 2 of 14 covariates were relevant to a simulated response. Unmatched randomizations experienced rare disasters which were consistently avoided by matched randomizations.},

Fox also explores diagnostic methods for discovering whether a linear model fit to data adequately represents the data; extensions to linear least squares, including logit and probit models, time-series regression, nonlinear regression, robust regression, and nonparametric regression; and empirical methods for assessing sampling variation, including the bootstrap and cross-validation. More difficult material is segregated in separate sections and chapters and several appendixes are also included presenting background information.

We distinguish between two aspects of this type of utility, intrinsic satisfaction from behaving in accordance with a norm and extrinsic incentives to comply, and test the effects of priming intrinsic motives and applying varying degrees of extrinsic pressure. A large-scale field experiment involving several hundred thousand registered voters used a series of mailings to gauge these effects. Substantially higher turnout was observed among those who received mailings promising to publicize their turnout to their household or their neighbors.

abstract = {By slightly reframing the concept of covariance adjustment in randomized experiments, a method of exact permutation inference is derived that is entirely free of distributional assumptions and uses the random assignment of treatments as the "reasoned basis for inference." This method of exact permutation inference may be used with many forms of covariance adjustment, including robust regression and locally weighted smoothers. The method is then generalized to observational studies where treatments were not randomly assigned, so that sensitivity to hidden biases must be examined. Adjustments using an instrumental variable are also discussed. The methods are illustrated using data from two observational studies.},

abstract = {There is a tension regarding the potential of the alternative agro-food movement to create meaningful change. From one perspective, individual and organizational actors working to change the dominant food system need to be engaged on a daily basis in political and social struggles and accomplish what is presently possible given existing opportunities and barriers. From an alternate view, such pragmatism is woefully inadequate for achieving the complete transformation of the food and agriculture system that many movement actors and academic analysts see as necessary. This paper examines some of the issues underlying this tension. It is argued that the "sustainability" of food and agriculture systems is understandably a contested concept because it inevitably involves both conflicts over values and uncertainty about outcomes. These same characteristics make democracy the method of choice for the alternative agro-food movement, and this paper discusses the emerging concept of "food democracy" in order to elaborate upon its practical utility with respect to collective action. The existing alternative agro-food movement is the main source of the pressure to democratize the agro-food system. While the movement in the United States (and elsewhere) is very diverse in terms of organizational forms and strategies, there are important opportunities for developing coalitions among various groups. Lastly, food democracy is discussed as a pragmatic method for transforming the agro-food system.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the medical and financial outcomes associated with surgery in elderly obese patients and to ask if obesity itself influences outcomes above and beyond the effects from comorbidities that are known to be associated with obesity. BACKGROUND: Obesity is a surgical risk factor not present in Medicare's risk adjustment or payment algorithms, as BMI is not collected in administrative claims. METHODS: A total of 2045 severely or morbidly obese patients (BMI >/= 35 kg/m, aged between 65 and 80 years) selected from 15,914 elderly patients in 47 hospitals undergoing hip and knee surgery, colectomy, and thoracotomy were matched to 2 sets of 2045 nonobese patients (BMI = 20-30 kg/m). A "limited match" controlled for age, sex, race, procedure, and hospital. A "complete match" also controlled for 30 additional factors such as diabetes and admission clinical data from chart abstraction. RESULTS: Mean BMI in the obese patients was 40 kg/m compared with 26 kg/m in the nonobese. In the complete match, obese patients displayed increased odds of wound infection: OR (odds ratio) = 1.64 (95\% CI: 1.21, 2.21); renal dysfunction: OR = 2.05 (1.39, 3.05); urinary tract infection: OR = 1.55 (1.24, 1.94); hypotension: OR = 1.38 (1.07, 1.80); respiratory events: OR = 1.44 (1.19, 1.75); 30-day readmission: OR = 1.38 (1.08, 1.77); and a 12\% longer length of stay (8\%, 17\%). Provider costs were 10\% (7\%, 12\%) greater in obese than in nonobese patients, whereas Medicare payments increased only 3\% (2\%, 5\%). Findings were similar in the limited match. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity increases the risks and costs of surgery. Better approaches are needed to reduce these risks. Furthermore, to avoid incentives to underserve this population, Medicare should consider incorporating incremental costs of caring for obese patients into payment policy and include obesity in severity adjustment models.},

For instance, encouragement to exercise might increase$\backslash$ncardiovascular fitness, but only indirectly to the extent that it$\backslash$nincreases exercise. If instrument levels are randomly assigned to$\backslash$nindividuals, then the instrument may permit consistent estimation$\backslash$nof the effects caused by the treatment, even though the treatment$\backslash$nassignment itself is far from random. For instance, one can conduct$\backslash$na randomized experiment assigning some subjects to 'encouragement$\backslash$nto exercise' and others to 'no encouragement' but, for reasons of$\backslash$nhabit or taste, some subjects will not exercise when encouraged and$\backslash$nothers will exercise without encouragement; none-the-less, such an$\backslash$ninstrument aids in estimating the effect of exercise. Instruments$\backslash$nthat are weak, i.e. instruments that have only a slight effect on$\backslash$nthe treatment, present inferential problems.

abstract = {Nearly all hierarchical linear models presented to political science audiences are estimated using maximum likelihood under a repeated sampling interpretation of the results of hypothesis tests. Maximum likelihood estimators have excellent asymptotic properties but less than ideal small sample properties. Multilevel models common in political science have relatively large samples of units like individuals nested within relatively small samples of units like countries. Often these level-2 samples will be so small as to make inference about level-2 effects uninterpretable in the likelihood framework from which they were estimated. When analysts do not have enough data to make a compelling argument for repeated sampling based probabilistic inference, we show how visualization can be a useful way of allowing scientific progress to continue despite lack of fit between research design and asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators.},

abstract = {The classical approach to the study of the transformation of social movements (here called the Weber-Michels model) predicts that a movement organization will become more conservative and that its goals will be displaced in favor of organizational maintenance. Using organizational and incentive analysis, the classical approach is subsumed under a more general set of concepts which lead to predictions about growth and change. The movement organization responds to the ebb and flow of sentiment in the larger society, to its relations with other movement organizations and to success or failure. Leadership and schismogenetic tendencies affect the nature and vicissitudes of its goals, and the recruitment and commitment of members. Neither greater conservatism nor organizational maintenance are iron laws.},

The differential effect of the two treatments is the effect of applying one treatment in lieu of the other. In randomised experiments, the differential effect is of no more or less interest than other treatment contrasts. Differential effects play a special role in certain observational studies in which treatments are not assigned to subjects at random, where differing outcomes may reflect biased assignments rather than effects caused by the treatments. Differential effects are immune to certain types of unobserved bias, called generic biases, which are associated with both treatments in a similar way. This is explored using several examples and models. Differential effects are not immune to differential biases, whose possible consequences are examined by sensitivity analysis.},

@article{Fran:1989,
abstract = {Theories demand much of data, often more than a single data collection can provide. For example, many important research questions are set in the past and must rely on data collected at that time and for other purposes. As a result, we often find that the data lack crucial variables. Another common problem arises when we wish to estimate the relationship between variables that are measured in different data sets. A variation of this occurs with a split half sample design in which one or more important variables appear on the ``wrong'' half. Finally, we may need panel data but have only cross sections available. In each of these cases our ability to estimate the theoretically determined equation is limited by the data that are available. In many cases there is simply no solution, and theory must await new opportunities for testing. Under certain circumstances, however, we may still be able to estimate relationships between variables even though they are not measured on the same set of observations. This technique, which I call two-stage auxiliary instrumental variables (2SAIV), provides some new leverage on such problems and offers the opportunity to test hypotheses that were previously out of reach. This article develops the 2SAIV estimator, proves its consistency and derives its asymptotic variance. A set of simulations illustrates the performance of the estimator in finite samples and several applications are sketched out.

@misc{Rosenbaum2009,
abstract = {In randomized experiments, it is sometimes important to demonstrate that two treatments do not differ greatly in their effects, or to demonstrate that the treatments have very different effects on one outcome but similar effects on another outcome. These “demonstrations” may take the form of rejecting a null hypothesis of inequivalence in an equivalence test, or rejecting a null hypothesis of equal and inequivalent effects on two outcomes. The procedures often express a complex hypothesis in terms of component hypotheses, and combine the component significance levels to test the complex hypothesis. If used in a randomized trial, randomization provides valid significance levels for each component test, and hence also for the combined procedure. In an observational study—that is, in a study of treatments that were not randomly assigned—there is typically concern that significance levels for testing hypotheses about treatment effects may be distorted by failure to control for some unobserved pretreatment covariate. This concern is raised in the evaluation of virtually all observational studies. The possible impact of such an unobserved covariate is clarified and displayed by a sensitivity analysis that, for various possible magnitudes of potential bias, yields a corresponding interval of possible significance levels. Some observational studies are sensitive to very small unobserved biases, whereas others are insensitive to large biases. Here, existing sensitivity analyses for component hypotheses are used to generate sensitivity analyses for complex hypotheses tested by combining component significance levels. We apply the procedure to our study of the timing of discharges of premature babies from neonatal intensive care units, focusing on the possible impact of delayed discharge on use of unplanned medical care after discharge.},

abstract = {One common view is that a well-designed empirical study will reach conclusions that can be found again and again if the study is replicated, whereas a poorly designed study is unlikely to replicate. In opposition to this view, it is argued that a well-designed empirical study reaches conclusions that tend to replicate when correct and are less likely to replicate when incorrect, whereas in a poorly designed study the conclusions tend to replicate even when incorrect. In observational studies of treatment effects, the same hidden bias may occur repeatedly in a series of studies, so the studies reproduce the same distorted estimates of treatment effects. The purpose of this article is to point to strategies in research design that make it less likely that biased estimates will replicate, and to illustrate these strategies with examples. To replicate effects without replicating biases, vary the treatment assignment mechanism, so that the reasons subjects are spared treatment are different in the original and replicated studies. Also, vary the treatment envelope-that is, the ostensibly irrelevant features in which the treatment is packaged.},

abstract = {Statisticians have contributed enormously to the
conceptualization, development, and success of case-control
methods for the study of disease causation and prevention.
This article reviews the major developments. It starts with
Cornfield's demonstration of odds ratio invariance under
cohort versus case-control sampling, proceeds through the
still-popular Mantel-Haenszel procedure and its extensions
for dependent data, and highlights (conditional) likelihood
methods for relative risk regression. Recent work on nested
case-control, case-cohort, and two-stage case-control
designs demonstrates the continuing impact of statistical
thinking on epidemiology. The influence of R. A. Fisher's
work on these developments is mentioned wherever possible.
His objections to the drawing of causal conclusions from
observational data on cigarette smoking and lung cancer are
used to introduce the problems of measurement error and
confounding bias. The resolution of such difficulties,
whether by further development and implementation of
randomized intervention trials or by causal analysis of
observational data using graphical models containing latent
variables, will challenge future generations of
statisticians.},

abstract = {An effect is attributable to treatment if it would not have been observed had the individual been exposed to control instead. Extending earlier results on attributable effects in unmatched groups, a method of exact randomization inference and sensitivity analysis is developed for case-referent, case-crossover, and cohort studies with matched sets, and a large sample approximation to the exact inference is given. The unmatched case, considered previously, has certain symmetries that the matched case, considered here, does not have. As a result, approximation for the matched case requires the use of the recently developed method of asymptotic separability, which was riot needed in the unmatched case. Several examples are presented, including a case-referent study of Helicobacter pylori infection as a cause of myocardial infarction, a case-crossover study of alcohol as a cause of injury, a cohort study of women who gave birth at home, and a study of the effects of cadmium exposure with a continuous outcome measuring kidney function. Unlike tests of no effect, inference about attributable effects has a different form in case-referent and cohort studies.},

abstract = {This paper develops asymptotic distribution theory for single-equation instrumental variables regression when the partial correlations between the instruments and the endogenous variables are weak, here modeled as local to zero. Asymptotic representations are provided for various statistics, including mio-stage least squares (TSLS) and limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimators, Wald statistics, and statistics testing overidentification and endogeneity. The asymptotic distributions are found to provide good approximations to sampling distributions with 10-20 observations per instrument. The theory suggests concrete guidelines for applied work, including using nonstandard methods for construction of confidence regions. These results are used to interpret Angrist and Krueger's (1991) estimates of the returns to education: whereas TSLS estimates with many instruments approach the OLS estimate of 6\%, the more reliable LIML estimates with fewer instruments fall between 8\% and 10\%, with a typical 95\% confidence interval of (5\%, 15\%).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand differences in length of stay for asthma patients between New York State and Pennsylvania across children's and general hospitals in order to better guide policy. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: All pediatric admissions for asthma in the states of Pennsylvania and New York using claims data obtained from each state for the years 1996-1998, n = 38,310. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort design to model length of stay (LOS), the probability of prolonged stay, conditional length of stay (CLOS or the LOS after stay is prolonged), and the probability of readmission, controlling for patient factors, state, location and hospital type. ANALYTIC METHODS: Logit models were used to estimate the probability of prolonged stay and readmission. The LOS and the CLOS were estimated with Cox regression. Model variables included comorbidities, income, race, distance from hospital, and insurance type. Prolonged stay was based on a Hollander-Proschan "New-Worse-Than-Used" test, corresponding to a three-day stay. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The LOS was longer in New York than Pennsylvania, and the probabilities of prolonged stay and readmission were much higher in New York than Pennsylvania. However, once an admission was prolonged, there were no differences in CLOS between states (when readmissions were not added to the LOS calculation). In both states, children's hospitals and general hospitals had similar adjusted LOS. CONCLUSIONS: Management of asthma appears more efficient in Pennsylvania than New York: Less severe patients are discharged faster in Pennsylvania than New York; once discharged, patients are less likely to be readmitted in Pennsylvania than New York. However, once a stay is prolonged, there is little difference between New York and Pennsylvania, suggesting medical care for severely ill patients is similar across states. Differences between children's and general hospitals were small as compared to differences between states. We conclude that policy initiatives in New York, and other states, should focus their efforts on improving the care provided to less severe patients in order to help reduce overall length of stay.},

Here$\backslash$nwe propose a third tool, fine balance, obtained using the assignment$\backslash$nalgorithm in a new way. We use all three tools to construct a matched$\backslash$nsample for an ongoing study of provider specialty in the treatment$\backslash$nof ovarian cancer. Fine balance refers to exact balance of a nominal$\backslash$ncovariate, often one with many categories, but it does not require$\backslash$nindividually matched treated and control subjects for this variable.$\backslash$nIn the example the nominal variable has 72 = 9 x 8 categories formed$\backslash$nfrom 9 possible years of diagnosis and 8 geographic locations or$\backslash$nSEER sites. We obtain exact balance on the 72 categories and close$\backslash$nindividual matches on clinical stage, grade, year of diagnosis, and$\backslash$nother variables using a distance, and stochastically balance a total$\backslash$nof 61 covariates using a propensity score. Our approach finds an$\backslash$noptimal match that minimizes a suitable distance subject to the constraint$\backslash$nthat fine balance is achieved. This is done by defining a special$\backslash$npatterned distance matrix and passing it to a subroutine that solves$\backslash$nthe optimal assignment problem, which optimally pairs the rows and$\backslash$ncolumns of a matrix using a polynomial time algorithm. In the example$\backslash$nwe used the function Proc Assign in SAS. A new theorem shows that$\backslash$nwith our patterned distance matrix, the assignment algorithm returns$\backslash$nan optimal, finely balanced matched sample whenever one exists, and$\backslash$notherwise returns an infinite distance, indicating that no such matched$\backslash$nsample exists.},

abstract = {Alternative food initiatives are appearing in many places. Observers suggest that they share a political agenda: to oppose the structures that coordinate and globalize the current food system and to create alternative systems of food production that are environmentally sustainable, economically viable, and socially just. This paper examines the potential of these initiatives through the lens of the concepts of `alternative and oppositional' social movements and `militant particularism and global ambition' developed by Raymond Williams and David Harvey. The three sections of this paper review (1) the current discussion of common themes and strategies in agrifood initiatives within the academic literature; (2) the history of these initiatives in California; and (3) results of our interviews with 37 current leaders of California organizations. We suggest that further understanding these initiatives, and success in the goals of the initiatives themselves, requires us to look past their similarities to examine their differences. These differences are related to the social forms and relations that have been established in the places from which these initiatives arise. `Social justice,' in particular, may be difficult to construct at a `local' scale.},

In this article, we borrow from Parsons and Shils to offer a conceptualization of context. This conceptualization, and a recognition of both Lippmann's pseduoenvironments and the statistical Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, lead us to a new measurement strategy. We propose a map-based measure to capture how ordinary people use information about their environments to make decisions about politics. Respondents draw their contexts on maps--deciding the boundaries of their relevant environments--and describe their perceptions of hte demographic make-up of these contexts. The evidence is clear: `pictures in our heads' do not resemble governmental administrative units in shape or content. By `bringing the person back in' to the measurement of context, we are able to marry psychological theories of information processing with sociological theories of racial threat.},

abstract = {Analyses of social network data have suggested that obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness all travel through social networks. Individuals exert ``contagion effects'' on one another through social ties and association. These analyses have come under critique because of the possibility that homophily from unmeasured factors may explain these statistical associations and because similar findings can be obtained when the same methodology is applied to height, acne, and headaches, for which the conclusion of contagion effects seems somewhat less plausible. The author uses sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the extent to which supposed contagion effects for obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness might be explained away by homophily or confounding and the extent to which the critique using analysis of data on height, acne, and headaches is relevant. Sensitivity analyses suggest that contagion effects for obesity and smoking cessation are reasonably robust to possible latent homophily or environmental confounding; those for happiness and loneliness are somewhat less so. Supposed effects for height, acne, and headaches are all easily explained away by latent homophily and confounding. The methodology that has been used in past studies for contagion effects in social networks, when used in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, may prove useful in establishing social influence for various behaviors and states. The sensitivity analysis approach can be used to address the critique of latent homophily as a possible explanation of associations interpreted as contagion effects.},

This paper makes a stunningly good case for relying on purposefully randomized or accidentally randomized experiments to relieve the doubts that afflict inferences from nonexperimental data. On further reflection, I realized that I may have been overcome with irrational exuberance. Moreover, with this great honor bestowed on my ``con'' article, I couldn't easily throw this child of mine overboard. As Angrist and Pischke persuasively argue, either purposefully randomized experiments or accidentally randomized ``natural'' experiments can be extremely helpful, but Angrist and Pischke seem to me to overstate the potential benefits of the approach. I begin with some thoughts about the inevitable limits of randomization, and the need for sensitivity analysis in this area, as in all areas of applied empirical work. I argue that the recent financial catastrop},

abstract = {Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are used in the analysis of cluster randomized trials (CRTs) because: 1) the resulting intervention effect estimate has the desired marginal or population-averaged interpretation, and 2) most statistical packages contain programs for GEE. However, GEE tends to underestimate the standard error of the intervention effect estimate in CRTs. In contrast, penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimates the standard error of the intervention effect in CRTs much better than GEE but is used less frequently because: 1) it generates an intervention effect estimate with a conditional, or cluster-specific, interpretation, and 2) PQL is not a part of most statistical packages. We propose taking the variance estimator from PQL and re-expressing it as a sandwich-type estimator that could be easily incorporated into existing GEE packages, thereby making GEE useful for the analysis of CRTs. Using numerical examples and data from an actual CRT, we compare the performance of this variance estimator to others proposed in the literature, and we find that our variance estimator performs as well as or better than its competitors.},

Analysis</I>, First Edition <p> The use of statistical
methods for categorical data has increased dramatically,
particularly for applications in the biomedical and social
sciences. Responding to new developments in the field as
well as to the needs of a new generation of professionals
and students, this new edition of the classic Categorical
Data Analysis offers a comprehensive introduction to the
most important methods for categorical data analysis. <p>
Designed for statisticians and biostatisticians as well as
scientists and graduate students practicing statistics,
<I>Categorical Data Analysis</I>, Second Edition summarizes
the latest methods for univariate and correlated
multivariate categorical responses. Readers will find a
unified generalized linear models approach that connects
logistic regression and Poisson and negative binomial
regression for discrete data with normal regression for
continuous data. Adding to the value in the new edition is
coverage of: <UL TYPE="DISC"> <LI> Three new chapters on
methods for repeated measurement and other forms of
clustered categorical data, including marginal models and
associated generalized estimating equations (GEE) methods,
and mixed models with random effects <LI>Stronger emphasis
on logistic regression modeling of binary and multicategory
data <LI>An appendix showing the use of SAS for conducting
nearly all analyses in the book <LI>Prescriptions for how
ordinal variables should be treated differently than
nominal variables <LI>Discussion of exact small-sample
procedures <LI>More than 100 analyses of real data sets to
illustrate application of the methods, and more than 600
exercises</UL>},

The likelihood function and likelihood ratios have clear intuitive meanings that make it easy for students to grasp the important concepts. Modern computing technology has made it possible to use these methods over a wide range of practical applications. However, many mathematical statistics textbooks, particularly those at the Senior/Masters level, do not give this important topic coverage commensurate with its place in the world of modern applications. Similarly, in nonlinear estimation problems, standard practice (as reflected by procedures available in the popular commercial statistical packages) has been slow to recognize the advantages of likelihood-based confidence regions/intervals over the commonly use "normal-theory" regions/intervals based on the asymptotic distribution of the "Wald statistic." In this note we outline our approach for presenting, to students, confidence regions/intervals based on ML estimation.},

abstract = {An observational or nonrandomized study of treatment effects may be biased by failure to control for some relevant covariate that was not measured. The design of an observational study is known to strongly affect its sensitivity to biases from covariates that were not observed. For instance, the choice of an outcome to study, or the decision to combine several outcomes in a test for coherence, can materially affect the sensitivity to unobserved biases. Decisions that shape the design are, therefore, critically important, but they are also difficult decisions to make in the absence of data.We consider the possibility of randomly splitting the data from an observational study into a smaller planning sample and a larger analysis sample, where the planning sample is used to guide decisions about design. After reviewing the concept of design sensitivity, we evaluate sample splitting in theory, by numerical computation, and by simulation, comparing it to several methods that use all of the data. Sample splitting is remarkably effective, much more so in observational studies than in randomized experiments: splitting 1,000 matched pairs into 100 planning pairs and 900 analysis pairs often materially improves the design sensitivity. An example from genetic toxicology is used to illustrate the method.},

abstract = {Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory. The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

Covariance adjustment can reduce bias in the estimate of the treatment effect (Cochran \& Rubin, 1973); however, baseline group differences with respect to unobserved covariates which cannot be controlled can lead to hidden bias. This article presents a simple method which uses omitted variable bias to assess the uncertainty of the hidden bias by describing what scenarios regarding the unobserved covariate can lead to a given level of hidden bias.

abstract = {Often, the protocol for a randomized controlled trial states that$\backslash$nif a patient's health deteriorates substantially in certain specific$\backslash$nways, then the study treatments will no longer be considered adequate$\backslash$nmedical care, and the patient will be taken off the study treatments$\backslash$nand given the needed care. Aberrant responses of this sort present$\backslash$nspecial problems of interpretation. The few such patients may have$\backslash$nreceived only limited exposure to the study treatments, but also$\backslash$nmay have experienced some of the worst outcomes observed in the trial.$\backslash$nThe most basic question is whether one of the treatments tends to$\backslash$ncause such aberrant responses, quite apart from any other beneficial$\backslash$nor harmful effects that treatment may have. Common practice is to$\backslash$nreduce aberrant responses to binary events and apply Fisher's exact$\backslash$ntest for a 2 x 2 table, but this approach discards the available$\backslash$ninformation about the magnitude of the aberration. We propose a new$\backslash$nrandomization test for this problem that uses information about both$\backslash$nthe number of aberrations and their magnitude. In extreme situations,$\backslash$nthe new test reduces to either Fisher's exact test or Wilcoxon's$\backslash$nrank sum test, but in common situations, the new test has features$\backslash$nof both methods. Importantly, this exact test reacts only to aberrant$\backslash$neffects; it is completely unaffected by treatment effects that do$\backslash$nnot produce aberrations. When aberrant responses have several aspects,$\backslash$nwe examine the consequences of selecting, after the fact, the one$\backslash$naspect exhibiting the greatest aberration, and applying the test$\backslash$nto that aspect. For a single response variable, a confidence interval$\backslash$nis proposed for an additive aberrant effect; the interval is constructed$\backslash$nby inverting the test, and a multivariate extension is briefly mentioned.$\backslash$nWe illustrate the use of the test in the ACE-Inhibitor After Anthracycline$\backslash$n(AAA) randomized trial, which was aimed at preserving cardiac function$\backslash$nin children treated for cancer. Seven of 135 children were removed$\backslash$nfrom the trial due to substantial cardiac declines; 6 of these were$\backslash$non placebo, I of whom subsequently died.},

Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. MCMC constitutes a revolution

the underlying statistical concepts. I demonstrate some of
the strengths and weaknesses of MCMC and offer practical
suggestions for using MCMC in social-science settings.
Simple, illustrative examples include a probit model of
voter turnout and a linear regression for time-series data
with autoregressive disturbances. I conclude with a more
challenging application, a multinomial probit model, to
showcase the power of MCMC methods.},

abstract = {<em>"The reason for my enthusiasm for this book is that
Doreen Massey manages to describe a certain way of
perceiving movement in space which I have been - and still
am - working with on different levels in my work: i.e. the
idea that space is not something static and neutral, a
frozen entity, but is something intertwined with time and
thus ever changing - also when we are not occupying it.
Doreen's descriptions of her journey through England for
example are clear and precise accounts of this idea, and
she very sharply characterizes the attempts not to
recognize this idea as utopian and nostalgic." </em><br />-
Olafur Eliasson <p></p><p></p><p>In this book, Doreen
Massey makes an impassioned argument for revitalising our
imagination of space. She takes on some well-established
assumptions from philosophy, and some familiar ways of
characterising the twenty-first century world, and shows
how they restrain our understanding of both the challenge
and the potential of space.</p><p></p><p>The way we think
about space matters. It inflects our understandings of the
world, our attitudes to others, our politics. It affects,
for instance, the way we understand globalisation, the way
we approach cities, the way we develop, and practice, a
sense of place. If time is the dimension of change then
space is the dimension of the social: the contemporaneous
co-existence of others. That is its challenge, and one that
has been persistently evaded. <b>For Space</b> pursues its
argument through philosophical and theoretical engagement,
and through telling personal and political reflection.
Doreen Massey asks questions such as how best to
characterise these so-called spatial times, how it is that
implicit spatial assumptions inflect our politics, and how
we might develop a responsibility for place beyond
place.</p><p></p><p>This book is "for space" in that it
argues for a reinvigoration of the spatiality of our
implicit cosmologies. <b>For Space </b>is essential reading
for anyone interested in space and the spatial turn in the
social sciences and humanities. Serious, and sometimes
irreverent, it is a compelling manifesto: for re-imagining
spaces for these times and facing up to their
challenge.</p>},

abstract = {Multilevel data are structures that consist of multiple
units of analysis, one nested within the other. Such data
are becoming quite common in political science and provide
numerous opportunities for theory testing and development.
Unfortunately, this type of data typically generates a
number of statistical problems, of which clustering is
particularly important. To exploit the opportunities
offered by multilevel data, and to solve the statistical
problems inherent in them, special statistical techniques
are required. In this article, we focus on a technique that
has become popular in educational statistics and
sociology-multilevel analysis. In multilevel analysis,
researchers build models that capture the layered structure
of multilevel data, and determine how layers interact and
impact a dependent variable of interest. Our objective in
this article is to introduce the logic and statistical
theory behind multilevel models, to illustrate how such
models can be applied fruitfully in political science, and
to call attention to some of the pitfalls in multilevel
analysis.},

and prognostic models in estimating treatment effects from
observational studies. One issue investigated was the
effect of estimating the propensity score on estimators of
treatment effect. It was found that estimating the
propensity score introduced no additional bias. A second
question addressed comparisons of the propensity score and
prognostic approach when a confounder is omitted. The
results indicate that biases due to omitted covariates are
large and of the same magnitude. Third, misspecifications
of the propensity score were compared to misspecified
response models. Here it was found that estimators obtained
from incorrect response models had much larger biases than
estimators from incorrectly estimated propensity scores. In
all cases there were two types of models, one involving a
continuous and one a binary response. Least squares
estimators for the continuous response were compared to
stratified mean differences between treatment groups. For
the binary response maximum likelihood estimators of the
odds ratio were compared to Mantel-Haenszel estimators. In
both cases the strata were based on the quintiles of the
true and estimated propensity scores.},

abstract = {In 2010, a magnitude 8.8 earthquake hit Chile, devastating parts of the country. Having just completed its national socioeconomic survey, the Chilean government reinterviewed a subsample of respondents, creating unusual longitudinal data about the same persons before and after a major disaster. The follow-up evaluated posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) using Davidson's Trauma Scale. We use these data with two goals in mind. Most studies of PTSS after disasters rely on recall to characterize the state of affairs before the disaster. We are able to use prospective data on preexposure conditions, free of recall bias, to study the effects of the earthquake. Second, we illustrate recent developments in statistical methodology for the design and analysis of observational studies. In particular, we use new and recent methods for multivariate matching to control 46 covariates that describe demographic variables, housing quality, wealth, health, and health insurance before the earthquake. We use the statistical theory of design sensitivity to select a study design with findings expected to be insensitive to small or moderate biases from failure to control some unmeasured covariate. PTSS were dramatically but unevenly elevated among residents of strongly shaken areas of Chile when compared with similar persons in largely untouched parts of the country. In 96\% of exposed-control pairs exhibiting substantial PTSS, it was the exposed person who experienced stronger symptoms (95\% confidence interval = 0.91-1.00).},

@article{Yang2012,
abstract = {In multivariate matching, fine balance constrains the marginal distributions of a nominal variable in treated and matched control groups to be identical without constraining who is matched to whom. In this way, a fine balance constraint can balance a nominal variable with many levels while focusing efforts on other more important variables when pairing individuals to minimize the total covariate distance within pairs. Fine balance is not always possible; that is, it is a constraint on an optimization problem, but the constraint is not always feasible. We propose a new algorithm that returns a minimum distance finely balanced match when one is feasible, and otherwise minimizes the total distance among all matched samples that minimize the deviation from fine balance. Perhaps we can come very close to fine balance when fine balance is not attainable; moreover, in any event, because our algorithm is guaranteed to come as close as possible to fine balance, the investigator may perform one match, and on that basis judge whether the best attainable balance is adequate or not. We also show how to incorporate an additional constraint. The algorithm is implemented in two similar ways, first as an optimal assignment problem with an augmented distance matrix, second as a minimum cost flow problem in a network. The case of knee surgery in the Obesity and Surgical Outcomes Study motivated the development of this algorithm and is used as an illustration. In that example, 2 of 47 hospitals had too few nonobese patients to permit fine balance for the nominal variable with 47 levels representing the hospital, but our new algorithm came very close to fine balance. Moreover, in that example, there was a shortage of nonobese diabetic patients, and incorporation of an additional constraint forced the match to include all of these nonobese diabetic patients, thereby coming as close as possible to balance for this important but recalcitrant covariate.},

abstract = {Without a doubt, there has been a ``credibility revolution'' in applied econometrics. One contributing development has been in the improvement and increased use in data analysis of ``structural methods''; that is, the use of models based in economic theory. Structural modeling attempts to use data to identify the parameters of an underlying economic model, based on models of individual choice or aggregate relations derived from them. Structural estimation has a long tradition in economics, but better and larger data sets, more powerful computers, improved modeling methods, faster computational techniques, and new econometric methods such as those mentioned above have allowed researchers to make significant improvements. While Angrist and Pischke extol the successes of empirical work that estimates ``treatment effects'' based on actual or quasi-experiments, they are much less sanguine about structural analysis and hold industrial organization up as an example where ``progress is less dramatic},

surveys, probit models are employed to test diverse

that personal economic circumstances play little role in
opinion formation, but beliefs about the state of the
national economy, anxiety over taxes, and generalized
feelings about Hispanics and Asians, the major immigrant
groups, are significant determinants of restrictionist
sentiment. This restricted role of economic motives rooted
in one's personal circumstances held true across ethnic

In an effort to compensate for the lack of randomization, treated and control units are often matched on the basis of observed covariates; however, the possibility remains of bias due to residual imbalances in unobserved covariates. A general though simple method is proposed for displaying the sensitivity of permutation inferences to a range of assumptions about unobserved covariates in matched observational studies. The sensitivity analysis is applicable to Wilcoxon's signed rank test, to the McNemar-Cox test for paired binary responses, and to some matching problems with a variable number of controls.},

abstract = {Abstract--Recently there has been a surge in econometric work focusing on estimating average treatment effects under various sets of assumptions. One strand of this literature has developed methods for estimating average treatment effects for a binary treatment under assumptions variously described as exogeneity, unconfoundedness, or selection on observables. The implication of these assumptions is that systematic (for example, average or distributional) differences in outcomes between treated and control units with the same values for the covariates are attributable to the treatment. Recent analysis has considered estimation and inference for average treatment effects under weaker assumptions than typical of the earlier literature by avoiding distributional and functional-form assumptions. Various methods of semiparametric estimation have been proposed, including estimating the unknown regression functions, matching, methods using the propensity score such as weighting and blocking, and combinations of these approaches. In this paper I review the state of this literature and discuss some of its unanswered questions, focusing in particular on the practical implementation of these methods, the plausibility of this exogeneity assumption in economic applications, the relative performance of the various semiparametric estimators when the key assumptions (unconfoundedness and overlap) are satisfied, alternative estimands such as quantile treatment effects, and alternate methods such as Bayesian inference.},

attracting serious attention of statisticians. Although
there exist recent discussions concerning the general
definition of causal effects and a substantial literature
on specific techniques for the analysis of data in
randomized and nonrandomized studies, there has been
relatively little discussion of modes of statistical
inference for causal effects. This presentation briefly
describes and contrasts four basic modes of statistical
inference for causal effects, emphasizes the common
underlying causal framework with a posited assignment
mechanism, and describes practical implications in the
context of an example involving the effects of switching
from a name-brand to a generic drug. A fundamental
conclusion is that in such nonrandomized studies,
sensitivity of inference to the assignment mechanism is the
dominant issue, and it cannot be avoided by changing modes
of inference, for instance, by changing from
randomization-based to Bayesian methods.},

They are organized into seven parts, each with an introduction by the author that provides historical and personal context and discusses the relevance of the work today. A concluding essay offers advice to investigators designing observational studies.

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Difference in breast cancer survival by race is a recognized problem among Medicare beneficiaries. OBJECTIVE: To determine if racial disparity in breast cancer survival is primarily attributable to differences in presentation characteristics at diagnosis or subsequent treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Comparison of 7375 black women 65 years and older diagnosed between 1991 to 2005 and 3 sets of 7375 matched white control patients selected from 99,898 white potential controls, using data for 16 US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) sites in the SEER-Medicare database. All patients received follow-up through December 31, 2009, and the black case patients were matched to 3 white control populations on demographics (age, year of diagnosis, and SEER site), presentation (demographics variables plus patient comorbid conditions and tumor characteristics such as stage, size, grade, and estrogen receptor status), and treatment (presentation variables plus details of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 5-Year survival. RESULTS: The absolute difference in 5-year survival (blacks, 55.9\%; whites, 68.8\%) was 12.9\% (95\% CI, 11.5\%-14.5\%; P < .001) in the demographics match. This difference remained unchanged between 1991 and 2005. After matching on presentation characteristics, the absolute difference in 5-year survival was 4.4\% (95\% CI, 2.8\%-5.8\%; P < .001) and was 3.6\% (95\% CI, 2.3\%-4.9\%; P < .001) lower for blacks than for whites matched also on treatment. In the presentation match, fewer blacks received treatment (87.4\% vs 91.8\%; P < .001), time from diagnosis to treatment was longer (29.2 vs 22.8 days; P < .001), use of anthracyclines and taxols was lower (3.7\% vs 5.0\%; P < .001), and breast-conserving surgery without other treatment was more frequent (8.2\% vs 7.3\%; P = .04). Nevertheless, differences in survival associated with treatment differences accounted for only 0.81\% of the 12.9\% survival difference. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the SEER-Medicare database, differences in breast cancer survival between black and white women did not substantially change among women diagnosed between 1991 and 2005. These differences in survival appear primarily related to presentation characteristics at diagnosis rather than treatment differences.},

This paper argues that in sufficiently large samples, the sta- tistical problems he raised are either minor or easily fixed. OLS adjustment improves or does not hurt asymptotic precision when the regression includes a full set of treatment-covariate interactions. Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be constructed with the Huber-White sandwich standard error estimator. Even the traditional OLS adjustment has benign large-sample prop- erties when subjects are randomly assigned to two groups of equal size. The strongest reasons to support Freedman's preference for unadjusted estimates are transparency and the dangers of specification search.

abstract = {Statistical analysis requires a probability model: commonly, a model for the dependence of outcomes Y on confounders X and a potentially causal variable Z. When the goal of the analysis is to infer Z's effects on Y , this requirement introduces an element of circularity: in order to decide how Z affects Y , the analyst first determines, speculatively, the manner of Y 's dependence on Z and other variables. This paper takes a statistical perspective that avoids such circles, permitting analysis of Z's effects on Y even as the statistician remains entirely agnostic about the conditional distribution of Y given X and Z, or perhaps even denies that such a distribution exists. Our assumptions instead pertain to the conditional distribution Z|X, and the role of speculation in settling them is reduced by the use of such techniques as propensity scores, poststratification, testing for overt bias before accepting a poststratification, and optimal full matching. Such beginnings pave the way for ``randomization inference'', an approach which, despite a long history in the analysis of designed experiments, is relatively new to political science and to other fields in which experimental data are rarely available. The approach applies to both experiments and observational studies. We illustrate this by applying it to analyze A. Gerber and D. Green's New Haven Vote 98 campaign. Conceived as both a get-out-the-vote campaign and a field experiment in political participation, the campaign as it turned out was in some ways more similar to an observational study than to a randomized experiment. Our analysis uses the strengths of the design of their study while adjusting for irregularities ignored by the original analysis. We estimate the number of voters who would not have voted had the campaign not prompted them to --- that is, the total number of votes attributable to the interventions of the campaigners. Both our statistical inferences about these attributable effects and the stratification and matching that precede them rely on quite recent developments from statistics; our matching, in particular, has novel features of potentially wide applicability. Our broad findings resemble those of the original analysis by Gerber and Green (2000), although in the small, the method offers additional information as to the campaign's effects upon interestingly different subgroups, such as older voters or those who have not voted in a previous election. },

Microarrays epitomize this type of technology, but similar situations arise in proteomics, spectroscopy, imaging, and social science surveys. This paper uses false discovery rate methods to carry out both size and power calculations on large-scale problems. A simple empirical Bayes approach allows the false discovery rate (fdr) analysis to proceed with a minimum of frequentist or Bayesian modeling assumptions. Closed-form accuracy formulas are derived for estimated false discovery rates, and used to compare different methodologies: local or tail-area fdr's, theoretical, permutation, or empirical null hypothesis estimates. Two microarray data sets as well as simulations are used to evaluate the methodology, the power diagnostics showing why nonnull cases might easily fail to appear on a list of ``significant'' discoveries.

abstract = {A general method for constructing permutation tests for
various experimental designs follows from invariance and
sufficiency. In this framework, randomization (or
rerandomization) tests are just special cases of
permutation tests. The methodology extends the
applicability of permutation tests: An example demonstrates
a test for an interaction effect in a factorial experiment,
a problem thought to be unapproachable by permutation or
randomization methods. Tests are constructed as follows.
The modeling of block and treatment effects closely
parallels classical analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA
assumptions of iid normal random errors are replaced,
however, by the much weaker assumption of exchangeability
of subsets of random errors. Distributional dependences on
the unknown nuisance parameters for blocks, covariates, and
untested treatments and on the unknown error distribution
are eliminated by invariance and sufficiency, respectively.
Initial reduction of the data by invariance appears to
extend considerably the applicability of permutation tests.
Because of the assumed exchangeability of the errors, the
sufficiency step leads to data permutations when computing
the test. The method also addresses some philosophical
problems associated with randomization tests. For instance,
in this article's framework, it is the design, and not the
data, which is always regarded as fixed, so ancillarity of
the design causes no difficulty.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, social capital in its various forms and contexts has emerged as one of the most salient concepts in social sciences . While much excitement has been generated, divergent views, perspectives, and expectations have also raised the serious question : is it a fad or does it have enduring qualities that will herald a new intellectual enterprise? This presentation's purpose is to review social capital as discussed in the literature, identify controversies and debates, consider some critical issues, and propose conceptual and research strategies in building a theory. I will argue that such a theory and the research enterprise must be based on the fundamental understanding that social capital is captured from embedded resources in social networks . Deviations from this understanding in conceptualization and measurement lead to confusion in analyzing causal mechanisms in the macro- and microprocesses. It is precisely these mechanisms and processes, essential for an interactive theory about structure and action, to which social capital promises to make contributions . The paper will begin by exploring the nature of capital and various theories of capital, so that social capital can be properly perceived and located . It will then identify certain controversies which, unless clarified or resolved, will hinder the development of a theory and the research enterprise . By considering social capital as assets in networks, the paper will discuss some issues in conceptualizations, measurements, and causal mechanisms (the factors leading to inequality of social capital and the returns following investments in social capital) . A proposed model will follow . The paper will conclude by calling attention to the rise of a new form of social capital, cybernetworks, and briefly suggesting how research on this topic promises to make important contributions to the research enterprise .},

Exact small-sample methods for discrete data use probability distributions that do not depend on unknown parameters. However, they are conservative inferentially: the actual error probabilities for tests and confidence intervals are bounded above by the nominal level. This article surveys ways of reducing or even eliminating the conservatism. Fuzzy inference is a recent innovation that enables one to achieve the error probability exactly. We present a simple way of conducting fuzzy inference for discrete one-parameter exponential family distributions. In practice, most scientists would find this approach unsuitable yet might be disappointed by the conservatism of ordinary exact methods. Thus, we recommend using exact small-sample distributions but with inferences based on the mid-P value. This approach can be motivated by fuzzy inference, it is less conservative than standard exact methods, yet usually it does well in terms of achieving desired error probabilities. We illustrate for inferences about the binomial parameter.},

The food systems/commoditychain analytical framework cannot fully explain therise of this new food. An adequate understanding ofthe consumer's role in the food system/commodity chainrequires more attention to consumption as a form ofpolitics. One way to do this is to look at thepolitics of other new social movements, especiallythose contesting mainstream notions of risk. From thisapproach, organic milk consumption challenges rBGHfrom a ``Not-in-my-Body'' or ``NIMB'' politics of refusal,similar to the political refusal of neighborhoodresidents in ``Not-in-My-Backyard'' or ``NIMBY''environmental movements. The NIMB form of politics isnot a social movement of politically consciousconsumers, yet it is still a political activity inwhich consumers participate in the formation of theindustry through a process of ``reflexive consumption.''An analysis of producer-consumer discourse on milkcartons reveals the nature of this political formation.},

in two important regards: (1) from direct to analogical

numerical to topological correspondence between formalism

Initiative and referendum processes furnish citizens with insufficient information about policy problems, inadequate choices among policy solutions, flawed criteria for choosing among such solutions, and few opportunities for reflection on those choices prior to decision making. We suggest a way to make direct democracy more deliberative by grafting randomly selected citizen assemblies onto existing institutions and practices. After reviewing the problems that beset modern direct-democratic elections and the long history of randomly selected citizen assemblies, we propose five different varieties of randomly constituted citizen bodies---Priority Conferences, Design Panels, Citizens' Assemblies, Citizens' Initiative Reviews, and Policy Juries. After selecting members through stratified random sampling of citizens, each of these assemblies would operate at a different stage of the legislative process, from initial problem identification through approval of a finished ballot measure. Highly structured procedures guided by professional moderators and featuring expert testimony on policy and legal matters would help to ensure deliberative quality, and careful institutional designs would make each body politically powerful. In the end, these citizen bodies would be likely to address the deliberative deficit of direct democracy and better achieve the public's desired policy objectives.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: It is generally thought that the use of preoperative antibiotics reduces the risk of postoperative infection, yet few studies have described the association between preoperative antibiotics and the risk of dying. The objective of this study was to determine whether preoperative antibiotics are associated with a reduced risk of death. METHODS: We performed a multivariate matched, population-based, case-control study of death following surgery on 1362 Pennsylvania Medicare patients between 65 and 85 years of age undergoing general and orthopedic surgery. Cases (681 deaths within 60 days from hospital admission) were randomly selected throughout Pennsylvania using claims from 1995 and 1996. Models were developed to scan Medicare claims, looking for controls who did not die and who were the closest matches to the previously selected cases based on preoperative characteristics. Cases and their controls were identified, and charts were abstracted to define antibiotic use and obtain baseline severity adjustment data. RESULTS: For general surgery, the odds of dying within 60 days were less than half in those treated with preoperative antibiotics within 2 hours of incision as compared with those without such treatment: (odds ratio = 0.44; 95\% confidence interval, 0.32-0.60), P < 0.0001). For orthopedic surgery, no significant mortality reduction was observed (OR = 0.85; 95\% confidence interval, 0.54-1.32; P < 0.464). INTERPRETATION: Preoperative antibiotics are associated with a substantially lower 60-day mortality rate in elderly patients undergoing general surgery. In patients who appear to be comparable, the risk of death was half as large among those who received preoperative antibiotics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications are common in the Medicare population, yet no study has formally quantified the change in prognosis that occurs after a broad range of first complications. OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the relative severity of 24 first postoperative complications. RESEARCH DESIGN: We undertook a multivariate matched, population-based, case-control study of death after surgery in a sample of 1362 Pennsylvania Medicare patients. SUBJECTS: Cases (681 deaths) were selected randomly using claims from 1995-1996. Models were developed to scan all Pennsylvania claims, looking for similar controls that did not die. MEASURES: Charts were abstracted, complications identified, and models were constructed to estimate the odds of dying after any 1 of 24 first postoperative complications. RESULTS: The odds of dying within 60 days increased 3.4-fold (95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.5-4.7) in patients with complications as compared with those without complications. A first complication of respiratory compromise was associated with a 7.2-fold increase in the odds of dying (95\% CI 4.5-11.6). The first complications of pneumonia or congestive heart failure were associated with, respectively, 5-fold (95\% CI 2.1-12.1) and 5.1-fold (2.3-11.1) increases in odds of dying as compared with no complication. CONCLUSIONS: First complications after surgery, even seemingly mild ones, may radically alter the patient's risk of death. First complications often begin the cascade of complications that end in death. Caregivers should consider the first complication as a timely signal of a changed clinical situation demanding a reevaluation of the patient's care. Researchers may use these estimates to determine the relative severity of a broad range of first or early complications.},

We distinguish between two aspects of this type of utility, intrinsic satisfaction from behaving in accordance with a norm and extrinsic incentives to comply, and test the effects of priming intrinsic motives and applying varying degrees of extrinsic pressure. A large-scale field experiment involving several hundred thousand registered voters used a series of mailings to gauge these effects. Substantially higher turnout was observed among those who received mailings promising to publicize their turnout to their household or their neighbors. These findings demonstrate the profound importance of social pressure as an inducement to political participation.},

abstract = {A new test is proposed comparing two multivariate distributions by using distances between observations. Unlike earlier tests using interpoint distances, the new test statistic has a known exact distribution and is exactly distribution free. The interpoint distances are used to construct an optimal non-bipartite matching, i.e. a matching of the observations into disjoint pairs to minimize the total distance within pairs.The cross-match statistic is the number of pairs containing one observation from the first distribution and one from the second. Distributions that are very different will exhibit few cross-matches.When comparing two discrete distributions with finite support, the test is consistent against all alternatives. The test is applied to a study of brain activation measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging during two linguistic tasks, comparing brains that are impaired by arteriovenous abnormalities with normal controls. A second exact distribution-free test is also discussed: it ranks the pairs and sums the ranks of the cross-matched pairs.},

on not one but two theories: a theory explaining the
phenomenon under study, another theory explaining the
generation of evidence concerning the phenomenon. The two
theories necessarily interact, setting important
constraints on each other. The second theory answers
questions about how the phenomenon leaves traces, how
analysts can observe those traces, and how analysts can
reconstruct attributes, elements, causes, and effects of
the phenomenon from those traces. As employed in studies of
contentious politics, event catalogs raise all these
questions. Competing conceptions of the phenomenon under
study as protest, as collective violence, as collective
action, as conflict, and as contentious claim-making imply
different measurement strategies. The strategy of
aggregation follows plausibly from identification of the
phenomenon as protest or violence, the strategy of
incidence from most of the competing conceptions, the
strategy of internal regularities only from treatments of
the crucial phenomenon as collective action, conflict, or
contentious claim-making.},

@article{cox90trs,
abstract = {The formal theory of statistical analysis depends on the
abstractions that the data are observed values of random
variables, that a family of probability distributions (a
model) has, at least tentatively, been formulated and that
the objective of the analysis is connected in some way with
the underlying `true' distribution. These ideas, while very
powerful, are idealizations and in particular the choice of
the model is of critical importance. In addition, many
challenging aspects of applied statistics are, of course,
concerned with such issues as the meaning and quality of
data, and the interpretation of carefully chosen tables and
graphs, matters where the probabilistic aspect is barely
visible. It is argued that, while the recognition of this
is important, the moral is not that descriptive statistics
should be separated from probabilistic statistics, but
rather that the common ground should be explored; what is
the formal theory underlying descriptive methods and how
can the results of analyses based on elaborate theory be
presented in a striking and easily understood way? There
are various aspects to the choice of models. A first
distinction is between primary aspects, which in effect
serve to define the aspects of substantive interest, and
secondary aspects which complete the specification and
which thereby indicate appropriate efficient methods of
analysis and how to calculate measures of uncertainty.
Often, but not necessarily, the latter concern assumptions
of distributional shape and of independence; they are
secondary not in the sense of being unimportant but rather
in not being the primary focus of substantive interest.
Models, especially in their primary aspects, are of three
broad types, substantive (i.e. based on special
subject-matter knowledge or theory), empirical representing
usually smooth dependencies without any strong
subject-matter input and indirect models which are useful,
for example, for calibration of descriptive methods. All
three types can be subdivided in various ways; see Cox
(1990). These ideas were illustrated in some detail by
discussing various kinds of model for precipitation, for
example hourly rainfalls, and by the issues involved in
predicting the AIDS epidemic. The importance of interplay
between substantive and empirical ideas was emphasized.},

abstract = {Summary In an observational or nonrandomized study of treatment effects, a sensitivity analysis indicates the magnitude of bias from unmeasured covariates that would need to be present to alter the conclusions of a na\"{\i}ve analysis that presumes adjustments for observed covariates suffice to remove all bias. The power of sensitivity analysis is the probability that it will reject a false hypothesis about treatment effects allowing for a departure from random assignment of a specified magnitude; in particular, if this specified magnitude is "no departure" then this is the same as the power of a randomization test in a randomized experiment. A new family of u-statistics is proposed that includes Wilcoxon's signed rank statistic but also includes other statistics with substantially higher power when a sensitivity analysis is performed in an observational study. Wilcoxon's statistic has high power to detect small effects in large randomized experiments-that is, it often has good Pitman efficiency-but small effects are invariably sensitive to small unobserved biases. Members of this family of u-statistics that emphasize medium to large effects can have substantially higher power in a sensitivity analysis. For example, in one situation with 250 pair differences that are Normal with expectation 1/2 and variance 1, the power of a sensitivity analysis that uses Wilcoxon's statistic is 0.08 while the power of another member of the family of u-statistics is 0.66. The topic is examined by performing a sensitivity analysis in three observational studies, using an asymptotic measure called the design sensitivity, and by simulating power in finite samples. The three examples are drawn from epidemiology, clinical medicine, and genetic toxicology.},

When a patient receives the treatment at time t, that patient is matched to another patient with a similar history of symptoms up to time t who has not received the treatment up to time t; this is risk set matching. By using a penalty function in integer programming in a new way, we force the marginal distributions of symptoms to be balanced in the matched treated and control groups. Among all balanced matchings, we pick the one that is optimal in the sense of minimizing the multivariate pretreatment covariate distance within matched pairs. Under a simple model for the treatment assignment mechanism, we study the sensitivity of the findings to hidden biases. In particular, we show that a simple, conventional sensitivity analysis is appropriate with risk set matching when the time to treatment follows a proportional hazards model with a time-dependent unobserved covariate.},

Previous theoretical arguments have shown that subclassification on the propensity score will balance all observed covariates. Subclassification on an estimated propensity score is illustrated, using observational data on treatments for coronary artery disease. Five subclasses defined by the estimated propensity score are constructed that balance 74 covariates, and thereby provide estimates of treatment effects using direct adjustment. These subclasses are applied within subpopulations, and model-based adjustments are then used to provide estimates of treatment effects within these subpopulations. Two appendixes address theoretical issues related to the application: the effectiveness of subclassification on the propensity score in removing bias, and balancing properties of propensity scores with incomplete data.

abstract = {Abstract
In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM), however, are consistent even in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications that use a HCCM appear to rely on the asymptotic version known as HC0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that HC0 often results in incorrect inferences when N $\backslash$leq 250, while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of the HCCM, and especially a version known as HC3, work well even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a HCCM whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2) the decision to use HCCM-based tests should not be determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and (3) when N $\backslash$leq 250, the HCCM known as HC3 should be used. Since HC3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors of statistical software to add this estimator to their programs.

abstract = {Hierarchical or \{"\}multilevel\{"\} regression models
typically parameterize the mean response conditional on
unobserved latent variables or \{"\}random\{"\} effects and
then make simple assumptions regarding their distribution.
The interpretation of a regression parameter in such a
model is the change in possibly transformed mean response
per unit change in a particular predictor having controlled
for all conditioning variables including the random
effects. An often overlooked limitation of the conditional
formulation for nonlinear models is that the interpretation
of regression coefficients and their estimates can be
highly sensitive to difficult-to-verify assumptions about
the distribution of random effects, particularly the
dependence of the latent variable distribution on
covariates. In this article, we present an alternative
parameterization for the multilevel model in which the
marginal mean, rather than the conditional mean given
random effects, is regressed on covariates. The impact of
random effects model violations on the marginal and more
traditional conditional parameters is compared through
calculation of asymptotic relative biases. A simple
two-level example from a study of teratogenicity is
presented where the binomial overdispersion depends on the
binary treatment assignment and greatly influences
likelihood-based estimates of the treatment effect in the
conditional model. A second example considers a three-level
structure where attitudes toward abortion over time are
correlated with person and district level covariates. We
observe that regression parameters in conditionally
specified models are more sensitive to random effects
assumptions than their counterparts in the marginal
formulation.},

Recent practice guidelines have advocated greater use of regional anesthesia for hip fracture surgery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To test the association of regional (ie, spinal or epidural) anesthesia vs general anesthesia with 30-day mortality and hospital length of stay after hip fracture.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study involving patients 50 years or older who were undergoing surgery for hip fracture at general acute care hospitals in New York State between July 1, 2004, and December 31, 2011. Our main analysis was a near-far instrumental variable match that paired patients who lived at different distances from hospitals that specialized in regional or general anesthesia. Supplementary analyses included a within-hospital match that paired patients within the same hospital and an across-hospital match that paired patients at different hospitals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPOSURES: Spinal or epidural anesthesia; general anesthesia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Thirty-day mortality and hospital length of stay. Because the distribution of length of stay had long tails, we characterized this outcome using the Huber M estimate with Huber weights, a robust estimator similar to a trimmed mean.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 56,729 patients, 15,904 (28\%) received regional anesthesia and 40,825 (72\%) received general anesthesia. Overall, 3032 patients (5.3\%) died. The M estimate of the length of stay was 6.2 days (95\% CI, 6.2 to 6.2). The near-far matched analysis showed no significant difference in 30-day mortality by anesthesia type among the 21,514 patients included in this match: 583 of 10,757 matched patients (5.4\%) who lived near a regional anesthesia-specialized hospital died vs 629 of 10,757 matched patients (5.8\%) who lived near a general anesthesia-specialized hospital (instrumental variable estimate of risk difference, -1.1\%; 95\% CI, -2.8 to 0.5; P = .20). Supplementary analyses of within and across hospital patient matches yielded mortality findings to be similar to the main analysis. In the near-far match, regional anesthesia was associated with a 0.6-day shorter length of stay than general anesthesia (95\% CI, -0.8 to -0.4, P < .001). Supplementary analyses also showed regional anesthesia to be associated with shorter length of stay, although the observed association was smaller in magnitude than in the main analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults in acute care hospitals in New York State undergoing hip repair, the use of regional anesthesia compared with general anesthesia was not associated with lower 30-day mortality but was associated with a modestly shorter length of stay. These findings do not support a mortality benefit for regional anesthesia in this setting.},

@article{Gu2013,
abstract = {A comparison and evaluation is made of recent proposals for multivariate matched sampling in observational studies, where the following three questions are answered: (1) Algorithms: In current statistical practice, matched samples are formed using "nearest available" matching, a greedy algorithm. Greedy matching does not minimize the total distance within matched pairs, though good algorithms exist for optimal matching that do minimize the total distance. How much better is optimal matching than greedy matching? We find that optimal matching is sometimes noticeably better than greedy matching in the sense of producing closely matched pairs, sometimes only marginally better, but it is no better than greedy matching in the sense of producing balanced matched samples. (2) Structures: In common practice, treated units are matched to one control, called pair matching or 1-1 matching, or treated units are matched to two controls, called 1-2 matching, and so on. It is known, however, that the optimal structure is a full matching in which a treated unit may have one or more controls or a control may have one or more treated units. Optimal 1 - k matching is compared to optimal full matching, finding that optimal full matching is often much better. (3) Distances: Matching involves defining a distance between covariate vectors, and several such distances exist. Three recent proposals are compared. Practical advice is summarized in a final section.},

This article describes and applies a method for using observational longitudinal data to make more transparent causal inferences about the impact of such events on developmental trajectories. The method combines 2 distinct lines of research: work on the use of finite mixture modeling to analyze developmental trajectories and work on propensity score matching. The propensity scores are used to balance observed covariates and the trajectory groups are used to control pretreatment measures of response. The trajectory groups also aid in characterizing classes of subjects for which no good matches are available. The approach is demonstrated with an analysis of the impact of gang membership on violent delinquency based on data from a large longitudinal study conducted in Montr\'{e}al, Canada.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resident duty hour reforms of 2003 had the potential to create a major impact on the delivery of inpatient care. OBJECTIVE: We examine whether the reforms influenced the probability of a patient experiencing a prolonged hospital length of stay (PLOS), a measure reflecting either inefficiency of care or the development of complications that may slow the rate of discharge. RESEARCH DESIGN: Conditional logistic models to compare PLOS in more versus less teaching-intensive hospitals before and after the reform, adjusting for patient comorbidities, common time trends, and hospital site. SUBJECTS: Medicare (N = 6,059,015) and Veterans Affairs (VA) (N = 210,276) patients admitted for medical conditions (acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, or gastrointestinal bleeding) or surgical procedures (general, orthopedic, and vascular) from July 2000 to June 2005. MEASURES: Prolonged length of stay. RESULTS: Modeling all medical conditions together, the odds of prolonged stay in the first year post reform at more versus less teaching intensive hospitals was 1.01 (95\% CI: 0.97-1.05) for Medicare and 1.07 (0.94-1.20) for the VA. Results were similarly negative in the second year post reform. For "combined surgery" the post year 1 odds ratios were 1.04 (0.98-1.09) and 0.94 (0.78-1.14) for Medicare and the VA respectively, and similarly unchanged in post year 2. Isolated increases in the probability of prolonged stay did occur for some vascular surgery procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals generally found ways to cope with duty hour reform without increasing the prevalence of prolonged hospital stays, a marker of either inefficient care or complications.},

attracting serious attention of statisticians. Although
there exist recent discussions concerning the general
definition of causal effects and a substantial literature
on specific techniques for the analysis of data in
randomized and nonrandomized studies, there has been
relatively little discussion of modes of statistical
inference for causal effects. This presentation briefly
describes and contrasts four basic modes of statistical
inference for causal effects, emphasizes the common
underlying causal framework with a posited assignment
mechanism, and describes practical implications in the
context of an example involving the effects of switching
from a name-brand to a generic drug. A fundamental
conclusion is that in such nonrandomized studies,
sensitivity of inference to the assignment mechanism is the
dominant issue, and it cannot be avoided by changing modes
of inference, for instance, by changing from
randomization-based to Bayesian methods.},

This is so for two reasons. First, the transition to graduate school is a good time to make changes. Early on, theres less inertia and cost associated with switching things around than there will be later. Second, in the social sciences, text and data management skills are usually not taught to students explicitly. This means that you may end up adopting the practices of your advisor or mentor, continue to use what you are taught in your methods classes, or just copy whatever your peers are doing. Following these paths may lead you to an arrangement that you will be happy with. But maybe not. Its worth looking at the options.},

@article{Lorch2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many children receive their care at local hospitals outside of a large urban area. There may be differences in the length of stay (LOS) between children hospitalized in rural versus urban hospitals. This study compared the differences in LOS, conditional LOS (CLOS), odds of prolonged stay, and 21-day readmission rates for children with 19 medical conditions and 9 surgical procedures admitted to rural, community, and large urban hospitals. METHODS: Discharge records for the hospitalizations of children 1 to 17 years of age were obtained from the New York Department of Public Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council for April 1996 to July 1998. The 19 medical and 9 surgical conditions were identified with the principal condition and procedure codes. Hospitals were classified into 1 of 5 geographic categories on the basis of United States rural-urban continuum codes, ie, large urban, suburban, moderate urban, small urban, or rural. LOS was defined as the period of time between hospital admission and discharge. Readmission rates were calculated for 21 days after discharge from the hospital. A prolonged stay for each condition was defined as any admission lasting beyond the prolongation point, or the day at which the rate of discharge began to decline, as determined with the Hollander-Proschan statistic. This aspect of LOS describes the ability of providers to treat uncomplicated cases of that specific principle diagnosis. CLOS, as a marker for the management of complicated cases, was defined as the LOS beyond the prolongation point. Cox and logistic regression models were developed to describe the geographic effects on the 4 outcome variables, after severity adjustment with 32 demographic and 11 comorbidity variables and adjustment for hospital clustering. RESULTS: Medical (N = 114,787) and surgical (N = 29,156) admissions to rural hospitals (N = 12,367) had similar outcomes, compared with all geographic categories except the large urban category. Medical patients admitted to rural hospitals had a shorter LOS (12\% increase in discharge rate), a shorter CLOS (12\% increase in discharge rate), and lower odds of prolonged stay (odds ratio: 0.80), compared with those in large urban hospitals. Surgical patients admitted to rural hospitals had a shorter LOS (12\% increase in discharge rate) and lower odds of prolonged stay (odds ratio: 0.81), compared with those in large urban hospitals. For individual conditions, rural hospitals in general had similar or improved LOS, compared with all other hospitals in the 2 states. The addition of hospital-level variables failed to change the results of the primary models. CONCLUSIONS: In their treatment of pediatric hospitalized patients, rural hospitals were not significantly different from hospitals in all geographic regions other than large urban areas. Rural hospitals appear to deliver similar care, compared with nonrural hospitals, for many of the common pediatric conditions included in this study. Additional research is needed to apply these results to other regions or states with different geographic distributions of hospitals and children, in order to determine the overall impact on the regionalization of pediatric care.},

abstract = {The article considers several working anarchies in the networked environment, and whether they offer a model for improving on the persistent imperfections of markets and states. I explore whether these efforts of peer mutualism in fact offer a sufficient range of capabilities to present a meaningful degree of freedom to those who rely on the capabilities it affords, and whether these practices in fact remain sufficiently nonhierarchical to offer a meaningful space of noncoercive interactions. The real utopias I observe here are perfect on neither dimension. Internally, hierarchy and power reappear, to some extent and in some projects, although they are quite different than the hierarchy of government or corporate organization. Externally, there are some spectacular successes, some failures to thrive, and many ambiguous successes. In all, present experience supports neither triumphalism nor defeatism in the utopian project. Peer models do work, and they do provide a degree of freedom in the capabilities they provide. But there is no inexorable path to greater freedom through voluntary open collaboration. There is a good deal of uncertainty and muddling through. The last part of the article suggests a theory of freedom that supports the significance of even these obviously imperfect peer systems with incomplete coverage of necessary human capabilities, and explains why expanding the domain of mutualism improves freedom and well-being under conditions of persistent market imperfection and an inevitably fallible state. Peer mutualism doesn't have to be perfect; it merely needs to offer a new dimension or sufficient diversity in how it instantiates capabilities and transmits power to offer us, who inhabit the systems that these peer systems perturb, a degree of freedom.},

abstract = {In observational studies, the distribution of treatment assignments is unknown, and therefore randomization tests are not generally applicable. However, permutation tests that condition on sample information about the treatment assignment mechanism can be applicable in observational studies, provided treatment assignment is strongly ignorable. These tests use the conditional distribution of the treatment assignments given a sufficient statistic for the unknown parameter of the propensity score. Several tests that are commonly used in observational studies are particular instances of this general procedure. Moreover, conditional permutation tests and covariance adjustment are closely related, in the sense that the conditional permutation distribution of the covariance adjusted difference leads to the same inferences as the conditional permutation distribution of the unadjusted difference of sample means. A backtrack algorithm is developed to permit efficient calculation of the exact conditional significance level, and two approximations are discussed. A clinical study of treatments for lung cancer is used to illustrate the technique. Conditional permutation tests extend previous large sample results on the propensity score by providing a basis for exact tests and confidence intervals in small observational studies when treatment assignment is strongly ignorable.

Here, the form of an 'optimal' subclassification is determined, i.e. a subclassi- fication which makes the treated and control subjects in the same subclass as similar as possible. This optimal form is simple, intuitive and quite practical, though it is rarely used. The optimal form has several consequences. First, it suggests that theoretical investigations may assume that observational studies have this form, for if they do not they may be changed to this form without a loss, and often with a gain. Second, in searching for an optimal subclassification, the search may be confined to subclassifications of this form, for one is sure to be optimal. Finally, it is shown that finding an optimal subclassification of this form may often be reduced to finding the minimum cost flow in a certain network, i.e. to a standard combinatorial optimization problem for which good algorithms exist.},

Having distinguished the two types, the paper then investigates the second - the gastronomic aesthetic - through the case study of Slow Food in Tuscany. The Slow Food movement seeks to heighten the aesthetic appreciation of typical products and works mainly through local groups and typical restaurants. Through the in-depth analysis of one such restaurant, the paper outlines three main strands in the gastronomic aesthetic: a practical aesthetics of restaurant organisation; an aesthetical-ethic of typical foods; and, an aesthetic of 'connectedness' or 'embeddedness' in which the food is seen as a reflection of surrounding socio-economic and ecological relationships. The paper concludes by drawing out the implications of the study of aesthetics for rural sociology.},

@article{yang2011matching,
abstract = {Summary In multivariate matching, fine balance constrains the marginal distributions of a nominal variable in treated and matched control groups to be identical without constraining who is matched to whom. In this way, a fine balance constraint can balance a nominal variable with many levels while focusing efforts on other more important variables when pairing individuals to minimize the total covariate distance within pairs. Fine balance is not always possible; that is, it is a constraint on an optimization problem, but the constraint is not always feasible. We propose a new algorithm that returns a minimum distance finely balanced match when one is feasible, and otherwise minimizes the total distance among all matched samples that minimize the deviation from fine balance. Perhaps we can come very close to fine balance when fine balance is not attainable; moreover, in any event, because our algorithm is guaranteed to come as close as possible to fine balance, the investigator may perform one match, and on that basis judge whether the best attainable balance is adequate or not. We also show how to incorporate an additional constraint. The algorithm is implemented in two similar ways, first as an optimal assignment problem with an augmented distance matrix, second as a minimum cost flow problem in a network. The case of knee surgery in the Obesity and Surgical Outcomes Study motivated the development of this algorithm and is used as an illustration. In that example, 2 of 47 hospitals had too few nonobese patients to permit fine balance for the nominal variable with 47 levels representing the hospital, but our new algorithm came very close to fine balance. Moreover, in that example, there was a shortage of nonobese diabetic patients, and incorporation of an additional constraint forced the match to include all of these nonobese diabetic patients, thereby coming as close as possible to balance for this important but recalcitrant covariate.},

abstract = {Social scientists almost always use statistical models
positing the dependent variable as a global, linear
function of X, despite suspicions that the social and
political world is not so simple, or that our theories are
so strong. Generalized additive models (GAMs) let
researchers fit each independent variable with arbitrary
nonparametric functions, but subject to the constraint that
the nonparametric effects combine additively. In this way
GAMs strike a sensible balance between the flexibility of
nonparametric techniques and the ease of interpretation and
familiarity of linear regression. GAMs thus offer social
scientists a practical methodology for improving on the
extant practice of global linearity by default. We
reanalyze published work from several subfields of
political science, highlighting the strengths (and
limitations) of GAMs. We estimate non-linear marginal
effects in a regression analysis of incumbent reelection,
nonparametric duration dependence in an analysis of cabinet
duration, and within-dyad interaction effects in a
reconsideration of the democratic peace hypothesis. We
conclude with a more general consideration of the
circumstances in which GAMs are likely to be of use to
political scientists, as well as some apparent limitations
of the technique.},

abstract = {Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are unlike traditional individually randomized trials because observations within the same cluster are positively correlated and the sample size (number of clusters) is relatively small. Although formulae for sample size and power estimates of CRT designs do exist, these formulae rely upon first-order asymptotic approximations for the distribution of the average intervention effect and are inaccurate for CRTs that have a small number of clusters. These formulae also assume that the intracluster correlation (ICC) is the same for each cluster in the CRT. However, for CRTs in which the clusters are classrooms or medical practices, the degree of ICC is often a factor of how many students are in each classroom or how many patients are in each practice. Specifically, smaller clusters are expected to have larger ICC than larger clusters. A weighted sum of the cluster means, D, is the statistic often used to estimate the average intervention effect in a CRT. T},

abstract = {Direct adjustment or standardization applies population weights to subclass means in an effort to estimate population quantities from a sample that is not representative of the population. Direct adjustment has several attractive features, but when there are many subclasses it can attach large weights to small quantities of data, often in a fairly erratic manner. In the extreme, direct adjustment can attach infinite weight to nonexistent data, a noticeable inconvenience in practice. This article proposes a method of model-based direct adjustment that preserves the attractive features of conventional direct adjustment while stabilizing the weights attached to small subclasses. The sample mean and conventional direct adjustment are both special cases of model-based direct adjustment under two different extreme models for the subclass-specific selection probabilities. The discussion of this method provides some insights into the behavior of true and estimated propensity scores: the estimated scores are better than the true ones for almost the same reason that direct adjustment can outperform the sample mean in a simple random sample. The method is applied to a nonrandom sample in an effort to estimate a discrete distribution of essay scores in the College Board's Advanced Placement Examination in Biology.

abstract = {A Bayesian method is developed for estimating neural
responses to stimuli, using likelihood functions
incorporating the assumption that spike trains follow
either pure Poisson statistics or Poisson statistics with a
refractory period. The Bayesian and standard estimates of
the mean and variance of responses are similar and
asymptotically converge as the size of the data sample
increases. However, the Bayesian estimate of the variance
of the variance is much lower. This allows the Bayesian
method to provide more precise interval estimates of
responses. Sensitivity of the Bayesian method to the
Poisson assumption was tested by conducting simulations
perturbing the Poisson spike trains with noise. This did
not affect Bayesian estimates of mean and variance to a
significant degree, indicating that the Bayesian method is
robust. The Bayesian estimates were less affected by the
presence of noise than estimates provided by the standard
method.},

Extending earlier results on attributable effects in unmatched groups, a method of exact randomization inference and sensitivity analysis is developed for case-referent, case-crossover, and cohort studies with matched sets, and a large sample approximation to the exact inference is given. The unmatched case, considered previously, has certain symmetries that the matched case, considered here, does not have. As a result, approximation for the matched case requires the use of the recently developed method of asymptotic separability, which was riot needed in the unmatched case. Several examples are presented, including a case-referent study of Helicobacter pylori infection as a cause of myocardial infarction, a case-crossover study of alcohol as a cause of injury, a cohort study of women who gave birth at home, and a study of the effects of cadmium exposure with a continuous outcome measuring kidney function.

abstract = {It has become common to lament Americans' tendency to
pursue individual interests apart from any institutional
association. But to those who charge that Americans are at
home watching television rather than getting involved in
their communities, Robert Wuthnow answers that while
certain kinds of civic engagement may be declining,
innovative new forms are taking their place. People are
still connected, but because of the realities of daily
life, they form ``loose connections.'' These more fluid
groups are better suited to dealing with today's needs than
the fraternal orders and ladies' auxiliaries of the past.
Wuthnow examines the challenges that must be faced if these
innovative forms of civic involvement are to flourish.
``America has always been a nation of joiners. Loose
Connections argues that we still have the habit, and it is
a good one, of reaching out and connecting to others in
order to participate in the civic life of our culture.
Wuthnow is an indispensable observer of the American civic
and religious scene.'' --Jean Bethke Elshtain, author of
Democracy on Trial ``This is a very important book,
especially in the context of the current debate over
'social capital' in America. Wuthnow presents an optimistic
picture of the state of American voluntary institutions.
One might sum up his view by saying that Alexis de

abstract = {An instrument or instrumental variable manipulates a treatment and affects the outcome only indirectly through its manipulation of the treatment. For instance, encouragement to exercise might increase cardiovascular fitness, but only indirectly to the extent that it increases exercise. If instrument levels are randomly assigned to individuals, then the instrument may permit consistent estimation of the effects caused by the treatment, even though the treatment assignment itself is far from random. For instance, one can conduct a randomized experiment assigning some subjects to 'encouragement to exercise' and others to 'no encouragement' but, for reasons of habit or taste, some subjects will not exercise when encouraged and others will exercise without encouragement; none-the-less, such an instrument aids in estimating the effect of exercise. Instruments that are weak, i.e. instruments that have only a slight effect on the treatment, present inferential problems. We evaluate a recent proposal for permutation inference with an instrumental variable in four ways: using Angrist and Krueger's data on the effects of education on earnings using quarter of birth as an instrument, following Bound, Jaeger and Baker in using simulated independent observations in place of the instrument in Angrist and Krueger's data, using entirely simulated data in which correct answers are known and finally using statistical theory to show that only permutation inferences maintain correct coverage rates. The permutation inferences perform well in both easy and hard cases, with weak instruments, as well as with long-tailed responses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Procedure times are important variables that often are included in studies of quality and efficiency. However, due to the need for costly chart review, most studies are limited to single-institution analyses. In this article, the authors describe how well the anesthesia claim from Medicare can estimate chart times. METHODS: The authors abstracted information on time of induction and entrance to the recovery room ("anesthesia chart time") from the charts of 1,931 patients who underwent general and orthopedic surgical procedures in Pennsylvania. The authors then merged the associated bills from claims data supplied from Medicare (Part B data) that included a variable denoting the time in minutes for the anesthesia service. The authors also investigated the time from incision to closure ("surgical chart time") on a subset of 1,888 patients. RESULTS: Anesthesia claim time from Medicare was highly predictive of anesthesia chart time (Kendall's rank correlation tau = 0.85, P < 0.0001, median absolute error = 5.1 min) but somewhat less predictive of surgical chart time (Kendall's tau = 0.73, P < 0.0001, median absolute error = 13.8 min). When predicting chart time from Medicare bills, variables reflecting procedure type, comorbidities, and hospital type did not significantly improve the prediction, suggesting that errors in predicting the chart time from the anesthesia bill time are not related to these factors; however, the individual hospital did have some influence on these estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesia chart time can be well estimated using Medicare claims, thereby facilitating studies with vastly larger sample sizes and much lower costs of data collection.},

abstract = {MEDLINE Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Difference in breast cancer survival by race is a recognized problem among Medicare beneficiaries. OBJECTIVE: To determine if racial disparity in breast cancer survival is primarily attributable to differences in presentation characteristics at diagnosis or subsequent treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Comparison of 7375 black women 65 years and older diagnosed between 1991 to 2005 and 3 sets of 7375 matched white control patients selected from 99,898 white potential controls, using data for 16 US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) sites in the SEER-Medicare database. All patients received follow-up through December 31, 2009, and the black case patients were matched to 3 white control populations on demographics (age, year of diagnosis, and SEER site), presentation (demographics variables plus patient comorbid conditions and tumor characteristics such as stage, size, grade, and estrogen receptor status), and treatment (presentation variables plus details of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 5-Year survival. RESULTS: The absolute difference in 5-year survival (blacks, 55.9\%; whites, 68.8\%) was 12.9\% (95\% CI, 11.5\%-14.5\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001) in the demographics match. This difference remained unchanged between 1991 and 2005. After matching on presentation characteristics, the absolute difference in 5-year survival was 4.4\% (95\% CI, 2.8\%-5.8\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001) and was 3.6\% (95\% CI, 2.3\%-4.9\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001) lower for blacks than for whites matched also on treatment. In the presentation match, fewer blacks received treatment (87.4\% vs 91.8\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001), time from diagnosis to treatment was longer (29.2 vs 22.8 days; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001), use of anthracyclines and taxols was lower (3.7\% vs 5.0\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001), and breast-conserving surgery without other treatment was more frequent (8.2\% vs 7.3\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}=\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.04). Nevertheless, differences in survival associated with treatment differences accounted for only 0.81\% of the 12.9\% survival difference. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the SEER-Medicare database, differences in breast cancer survival between black and white women did not substantially change among women diagnosed between 1991 and 2005. These differences in survival appear primarily related to presentation characteristics at diagnosis rather than treatment differences},

abstract = {The assignment algorithm is an old, well-known, widely implemented, fast, combinatorial algorithm for optimal matching in a bipartite graph. This note proposes a method for using the assignment algorithm to solve the problem of optimal matching with a variable number of controls, in which there is a choice not only of who to select as a control for each treated subject, but also of how many controls to have for each treated subject. The strategy uses multiple copies of treated subjects and sinks with zero cost to absorb extra controls. Also, it is shown that an optimal matching with variable numbers of controls cannot be obtained by starting with an optimal pair matching and adding the closest additional controls. An example involving mortality after surgery in Pennsylvania hospitals is used to illustrate the method.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We ask whether Medicare's Hospital Compare random effects model correctly assesses acute myocardial infarction (AMI) hospital mortality rates when there is a volume-outcome relationship. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Medicare claims on 208,157 AMI patients admitted in 3,629 acute care hospitals throughout the United States. STUDY DESIGN: We compared average-adjusted mortality using logistic regression with average adjusted mortality based on the Hospital Compare random effects model. We then fit random effects models with the same patient variables as in Medicare's Hospital Compare mortality model but also included terms for hospital Medicare AMI volume and another model that additionally included other hospital characteristics. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Hospital Compare's average adjusted mortality significantly underestimates average observed death rates in small volume hospitals. Placing hospital volume in the Hospital Compare model significantly improved predictions. CONCLUSIONS: The Hospital Compare random effects model underestimates the typically poorer performance of low-volume hospitals. Placing hospital volume in the Hospital Compare model, and possibly other important hospital characteristics, appears indicated when using a random effects model to predict outcomes. Care must be taken to insure the proper method of reporting such models, especially if hospital characteristics are included in the random effects model.},

abstract = {It is now well known that standard statistical procedures become invalidated when applied to cluster randomized trials in which the unit of inference is the individual. A resulting consequence is that researchers conducting such trials are faced with a multitude of design choices, including selection of the primary unit of inference, the degree to which clusters should be matched or stratified by prognostic factors at baseline, and decisions related to cluster subsampling. Moreover, application of ethical principles developed for individually randomized trials may also require modification. We discuss several topics related to these issues, with emphasis on the choices that must be made in the planning stages of a trial and on some potential pitfalls to be avoided.

abstract = {Randomization in experiments allows researchers to assume that the treatment and con- trol groups are balanced with respect to all characteristics except the treatment. As such, treatment effects can be estimated with a simple difference of means-no other covariates are necessary. Still, analysts often adjust using experimental data for additional covariates with statistical models. In this paper, we address the issue of adjustment with experimental data. First, we outline the motivations for adjustment of experimental. We then review design based and analytic strategies for addressing these underlying motivations. We offer a com- parison of the most common method of adjustment---the standard least squares regression to estimate an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model---to two methods of statistical ad- justment that avoid ANCOVA's strong functional form assumption: Rosenbaum's method of covariate adjustment and matching. For all methods of adjustment, we outline a design and analytic strategy that maximizes transparency and illuminates whether inferences are adjustment dependent. Finally, we evaluate these methods of adjustment and demonstrate our design strategy with an original experiment on racial priming.},

This paper deals with balancing groups with respect to prognostic factors in clinical trials, as a means of increasing the power of a study. We use the Mantel-Haenszel statistic to obtain a simple measure for assessing the relative efficiency of different factors for stratification and to find optimal cutpoints for the given factors. For any available database, the measure can be used to construct optimal strata for a clinical trial. The paper also presents a practical approach for reducing the number of strata using discriminant regions with a method of assessing the effectiveness of this approach. An example from a large database of severe head trauma patients illustrates the utility of the measure.},

First, pairs must not only balance covariates, but also must differ markedly in dose. Second, any two subjects may be paired, so that the matching is nonbipartite, and different algorithms are required. Finally, a propensity score with doses must be used in place of the conventional propensity score. We illustrate multivariate matching with doses using pilot data from a media campaign against drug abuse. The media campaign is intended to change attitudes and intentions related to illegal drugs, and the evaluation compares stated intentions among ostensibly comparable teens who reported markedly different exposures to the media campaign.

between a treatment and outcomes is important in judging
whether the association is causal. An attempt is made to

Second, the sensitivity of the test to hidden bias is
examined. The question is whether a coherent pattern of
associations implies less sensitivity to hidden biases. An

abstract = {An instrument manipulates a treatment that it does not entirely control, but the instrument affects the outcome only indirectly through its manipulation of the treatment. The idealized prototype is the randomized encouragement design, in which subjects are randomly assigned to receive either encouragement to accept the treatment or no such encouragement, but not all subjects comply by doing what they are encouraged to do, and the situation is such that only the treatment itself, not disregarded encouragement alone, can affect the outcome. An instrument is weak if it has only a slight impact on acceptance of the treatment, that is, if most people disregard encouragement to accept the treatment. Typical applications of instrumental variables are not ideal; encouragement is not randomized, although it may be assigned in a far less biased manner than the treatment itself. Using the concept of design sensitivity, we study the sensitivity of instrumental variable analyses to departures from the ideal of random assignment of encouragement, with particular reference to the strength of the instrument. With these issues in mind, we reanalyze a clever study by Angrist and Krueger concerning the effects of military service during World War II on subsequent earnings, in which birth cohorts of very similar but not identical age were differently “encouraged” to serve in the war. A striking feature of this example is that those who served earned more, but the effect of service on earnings appears to be negative; that is, the instrumental variables analysis reverses the sign of the naive comparison. For expository purposes, this example has the convenient feature of enabling, by selecting different birth cohorts, the creation of instruments of varied strength, from extremely weak to fairly strong, although separated by the same time interval and thus perhaps similarly biased. No matter how large the sample size becomes, even if the effect under study is quite large, studies with weak instruments are extremely sensitive to tiny biases, whereas studies with stronger instruments can be insensitive to moderate biases.},

abstract = {In a randomized trial, subjects are assigned to treatment or control by the flip of a fair coin. In many nonrandomized or observational studies, subjects find their way to treatment or control in two steps, either or both of which may lead to biased comparisons. By a vague process, perhaps affected by proximity or sociodemographic issues, subjects find their way to institutions that provide treatment. Once at such an institution, a second process, perhaps thoughtful and deliberate, assigns individuals to treatment or control. In the current article, the institutions are hospitals, and the treatment under study is the use of general anesthesia alone versus some use of regional anesthesia during surgery. For a specific operation, the use of regional anesthesia may be typical in one hospital and atypical in another. A new matched design is proposed for studies of this sort, one that creates two types of nonoverlapping matched pairs. Using a new extension of optimal matching with fine balance, pairs of the first type exactly balance treatment assignment across institutions, so each institution appears in the treated group with the same frequency that it appears in the control group; hence, differences between institutions that affect everyone in the same way cannot bias this comparison. Pairs of the second type compare institutions that assign most subjects to treatment and other institutions that assign most subjects to control, so each institution is represented in the treated group if it typically assigns subjects to treatment or, alternatively, in the control group if it typically assigns subjects to control, and no institution appears in both groups. By and large, in the second type of matched pair, subjects became treated subjects or controls by choosing an institution, not by a thoughtful and deliberate process of selecting subjects for treatment within institutions. The design provides two evidence factors, that is, two tests of the null hypothesis of no treatment effect that are independent when the null hypothesis is true, where each factor is largely unaffected by certain unmeasured biases that could readily invalidate the other factor. The two factors permit separate and combined sensitivity analyses, where the magnitude of bias affecting the two factors may differ. The case of knee surgery in the study of regional versus general anesthesia is considered in detail.},

The essay by Angrist and Pischke, in its enthusiasm for some real accomplishments in certain subfields of economics, makes overbroad claims for its favored methodologies. What the essay says about macroeconomics is mainly nonsense. Consequently, I devote the central part of my comment to describing the main developments that have helped take some of the con out of macroeconomics. Recent enthusiasm for single-equation, linear, instrumental variables approaches in applied microeconomics has led many in these fields to avoid undertaking research that would require them to think formally },

abstract = {In a randomized experiment comparing two treatments, there is interference between units if applying the treatment to one unit may affect other units. Interference implies that treatment effects are not comparisons of two potential responses that a unit may exhibit, one under treatment and the other under control, but instead are inherently more complex. Interference is common in social settings where people communicate, compete, or spread disease; in studies that treat one part of an organism using a symmetrical part as control; in studies that apply different treatments to the same organism at different times; and in many other situations. Available statistical tools are limited. For instance, Fisher's sharp null hypothesis of no treatment effect implicitly entails no interference, and so his randomization test may be used to test no effect, but conventional ways of inverting the test to obtain confidence intervals, say for an additive effect, are not applicable with interference. Another commonly used approach assumes that interference is of a simple parametric form confined to units that are near one another in time or space; this is useful when applicable but is of little use when interference may be widespread and of uncertain form. Exact, nonparametric methods are developed for inverting randomization tests to obtain confidence intervals for magnitudes of effect assuming nothing at all about the structure of the interference between units. The limitations of these methods are discussed. To illustrate the general approach, two simple methods and two simple empirical examples are discussed. Extension to randomization based covariance adjustment is briefly described.},

abstract = {We develop a Bayesian ``sum-of-trees'' model where each tree is constrained by a regularization prior to be a weak learner, and fitting and inference are accomplished via an iterative Bayesian backfitting MCMC algorithm that generates samples from a posterior. Effectively, BART is a nonparametric Bayesian regression approach which uses dimensionally adaptive random basis elements. Motivated by ensemble methods in general, and boosting algorithms in particular, BART is defined by a statistical model: a prior and a likelihood. This approach enables full posterior inference including point and interval estimates of the unknown regression function as well as the marginal effects of potential predictors. By keeping track of predictor inclusion frequencies, BART can also be used for model-free variable selection. BART's many features are illustrated with a bake-off against competing methods on 42 different data sets, with a simulation experiment and on a drug discovery classification problem.

abstract = {We draw attention to two problems associated with the use of instrumental variables (IV), the importance of which for empirical work has not been fully appreciated. First, the use of instruments that explain little of the variation in the endogenous explanatory variables can lead to large inconsistencies in the IV estimates even if only a weak relationship exists between the instruments and the error in the structural equation. Second, in finite samples, IV estimates are biased in the same direction as ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. The magnitude of the bias of IV estimates approaches that of OLS estimates as the R(2) between the instruments and the endogenous explanatory variable approaches 0. To illustrate these problems, we reexamine the results of a recent paper by Angrist and Krueger, who used large samples from the U.S. Census to estimate wage equations in which quarter of birth is used as an instrument for educational attainment. We find evidence that, despite huge sample sizes, their IV estimates may suffer from finite-sample bias and may be inconsistent as well. These findings suggest that valid instruments may be more difficult to find than previously imagined. They also indicate that the use of large data sets does not necessarily insulate researchers from quantitatively important finite-sample biases. We suggest that the partial R(2) and the F statistic of the identifying instruments in the first-stage estimation are useful indicators of the quality of the IV estimates and should be routinely reported.d},

abstract = {Community food security (CFS) is an incipient movement based on the re-localization of many food system activities in response to values concerning the social, health, economic, and environmental consequences of the globalizing food system. This study examines the salience of these values based on the action agendas and accomplishments emerging from community planning events in six rural counties of New York, and the nature and type of participation and local support. The study finds a high level of agreement between CFS values as articulated by national leaders in this incipient movement and the action agendas. Further evidence of the salience of these themes is seen in the levels and types of activities and accomplishments taking place 8--12 months after the planning events. However, these follow-through activities appear to have been impeded by a variety of government regulations, uneven levels of support from community organizations and agencies, and a policy environment of fiscal austerity, narrow outcome-oriented accountability, and allocation of agency staff toward special-purpose grants and contracts. Many of these constraints are likely to exist in other communities and are beyond the scope of what community volunteers and practitioners can be expected to address on their own.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Difference in breast cancer survival by race is a recognized problem among Medicare beneficiaries. OBJECTIVE: To determine if racial disparity in breast cancer survival is primarily attributable to differences in presentation characteristics at diagnosis or subsequent treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Comparison of 7375 black women 65 years and older diagnosed between 1991 to 2005 and 3 sets of 7375 matched white control patients selected from 99,898 white potential controls, using data for 16 US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) sites in the SEER-Medicare database. All patients received follow-up through December 31, 2009, and the black case patients were matched to 3 white control populations on demographics (age, year of diagnosis, and SEER site), presentation (demographics variables plus patient comorbid conditions and tumor characteristics such as stage, size, grade, and estrogen receptor status), and treatment (presentation variables plus details of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 5-Year survival. RESULTS: The absolute difference in 5-year survival (blacks, 55.9\%; whites, 68.8\%) was 12.9\% (95\% CI, 11.5\%-14.5\%; P < .001) in the demographics match. This difference remained unchanged between 1991 and 2005. After matching on presentation characteristics, the absolute difference in 5-year survival was 4.4\% (95\% CI, 2.8\%-5.8\%; P < .001) and was 3.6\% (95\% CI, 2.3\%-4.9\%; P < .001) lower for blacks than for whites matched also on treatment. In the presentation match, fewer blacks received treatment (87.4\% vs 91.8\%; P < .001), time from diagnosis to treatment was longer (29.2 vs 22.8 days; P < .001), use of anthracyclines and taxols was lower (3.7\% vs 5.0\%; P < .001), and breast-conserving surgery without other treatment was more frequent (8.2\% vs 7.3\%; P = .04). Nevertheless, differences in survival associated with treatment differences accounted for only 0.81\% of the 12.9\% survival difference. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the SEER-Medicare database, differences in breast cancer survival between black and white women did not substantially change among women diagnosed between 1991 and 2005. These differences in survival appear primarily related to presentation characteristics at diagnosis rather than treatment differences.},

abstract = {R. A. Fisher's classic text on the design of experiments
is the principal source of inspiration for a model of data
interpretation that is usually characterized as
randomization analysis. In Chapter III of this text, Fisher
briefly commented on how to make a randomization test on
some data generated by a Darwin experiment. Two variants of
this randomization test are discussed in this article. The
variant that is discussed in Section 4 may be regarded as
the forerunner of all nonparametric tests. The original
variant of the test is discussed in Section 6. The author
concludes that the Fisher randomization test is not
logically viable.},

Special emphasis is given to recent developments in accurate approximation of densities, distribution functions and likelihood functions, and to the role of conditioning in these approximations. Exact conditional or marginal inference is available for essentially two classes of models, exponential family models and transformation family models. The approximations are very useful for practical implementation of these exact results. The form of the approximations suggests methods for inference in more general families.},

abstract = {In an effort to detect hidden biases due to failure to control for an unobserved covariate, some observational or nonrandomized studies include two control groups selected to systematically vary the unobserved covariate. Comparisons of the treated group and two control groups must, of course, control for imbalances in observed covariates. Using the three groups, we form pairs optimally matched for observed covariates-that is, we optimally construct from observational data an incomplete block design. The incomplete block design may use all available data, or it may use data selectively to produce a balanced incomplete block design, or it may be the basis for constructing a matched sample when expensive outcome information is to be collected only for sampled individuals. The problem of optimal pair matching with two control groups is shown by a series of transformations to be equivalent to a particular form of optimal nonbipartite matching, a problem for which polynomial time algorithms exist. In our examples, we implement the procedure using a nonbipartite matching algorithm due to Derigs. We illustrate the method with data from an observational study of the employment effects of the minimum wage.},

Ismail (Chairman) Prof (Dr) Mad Nasir B HJ Shamsudin (Member) Associate Prof (Dr) Amin Mahir Bin Abdullah (Member) INTRODUCTION The major challenge facing most developing countries is how to achieve the millennium development goal number one, which is the eradication of hunger and poverty by 2015. Although still of central importance in household income, agriculture on its own is increasingly unable to provide sufficient means of survival and livelihood to rural dwellers, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Agriculture has undoubtedly become the most important sub-sector in the Nigerian economy next only to petroleum. The sector employs about 70 percent of the workforce while accounting for slightly more than 40 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Central Bank of Nigeria and United State Agency for International Development (CBN, 2008; USAID, 2013). Recent evidences suggest that farming income alone is unable to cater for the entire needs of rural households [Ellis, 1998; 1999]. This is why the farmers are still looking for diverse opportunities to increase and stabilize their incomes and consumption [Chapman and Tripp, 2004]. Babatunde (2009; Ibekwe, et al., 2012) reported that, farming households in Northern Nigeria often pursue different non-agricultural activities simultaneously or at different times throughout the year. Traditionally, rural income is equated with farm or agricultural income, but very few households derive the entire source of their livelihood from agriculture. Literature converge that on the average, roughly 40 percent of African rural household income on average being derived from non-farm source (Ellis 1999; Babatunde, 2006). PROBLEM STATEMENT In spite of the key roles NFIGA played in uplifting the general wellbeing and livelihoods of rural people in developing economies and providing about 40\% of rural total income, studies that explore the impact of non-farm sector on the food consumption expenditure are still scanty. Most studies on non-farm diversification in developing countries tend to focus more on the causes, patterns and determinants less attention is accorded to the actual impacts of such strategies on the real gains in food security and the general wellbeing of the rural households. Likewise, many studies adopted OLS and non-probability regression models that do not account for the selection bias. To fill in this knowledge gap, the current study seeks not only to assess the predictors of non-farm diversification, but also to determine the potential impacts of NFIGA on real food expenditure and food security of rural households in Nigeria using 2010 post-planting GHS-panel data. The study is meant to build on the existing knowledge on the non-farm income diversification on food security and the wellbeing of rural households in Nigeria. The study used PSM technique which is capable of taking care of selection bias and as the most commonly being used in many current impact studies in education, agriculture and many social and medical sciences. LITERATURE REVIEW There are a number of motives that influence the decision by rural household to diversify their portfolios away from agriculture to off-farm and other non-farm activities. Babatunde, 2008 argued that, shrinking land availability is among the main reasons for the growing role of off-farm income among farm households in developing countries. Ellis (1998; 1999 \& Ahmed, 2012) also reported that, households diversified their portfolios to avert poverty, food insecurity, risk considerations; consumption smoothing, labour allocation smoothing, credit market failures and shock coping strategies. Several studies in Nigeria reported a substantial and increasing share of both off-farm and non-farm income in the total household income. For example Babatunde and Qaim, (2010) reported that 65 per cent small-holder farmers households participated in off-farm employment in which 50 per cent of their total income comes from off-farm activities. A number of recent articles examine aspects of income diversification using different case studies in Nigeria to provide empirical evidence (Legg et al., 2005,Nasa’i, 2010, Adewunmiet al., 2011). METODOLOGY In recent years, PSM is the most commonly used technique in non-experimental causal studies to evaluate the impact of a particular intervention or participation in a particular program that addresses the issue of selection bias. Propensity score matching has recently been used in several studies to evaluate the impacts of different programs related to agriculture, poverty and food security. For example, Becker and Inchino (2002; Owusu et al, 2011). The propensity score can be calculated by averaging the conditional effects over propensity score distribution of diversified households as follows: $\Delta$│E=1=Ep(x)\{E(Y1i│P(Xi), Ei=1)-E(Y0i│P(Xi),Ei=0)\}│Ei=1\}\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots..(1) RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This study reveals an increase in food expenditure due to participation in NFIGA, the average treatment effects on treated ATT of N1571.52 to N11654.07 were obtained using nearest neighbour and radius matching techniques (see table 1). The mean food expenditure due to participation in non-farm income generating activities as was computed N11071.48 that is (N66142.86 minus N55071.38) based on the sample size before estimating PSM. Therefore, estimation of counterfactuals with complete sample underestimates the impact NFIGA diversification by N654.07. The two basic assumptions (confoundedness and common support) were all satisfied by the model.

abstract = {Statistical analysis requires a probability model: commonly, a model for the dependence of outcomes Y on confounders X and a potentially causal variable Z. When the goal of the analysis is to infer Z's effects on Y , this requirement introduces an element of circularity: in order to decide how Z affects Y , the analyst first determines, speculatively, the manner of Y 's dependence on Z and other variables. This paper takes a statistical perspective that avoids such circles, permitting analysis of Z's effects on Y even as the statistician remains entirely agnostic about the conditional distribution of Y given X and Z, or perhaps even denies that such a distribution exists. Our assumptions instead pertain to the conditional distribution Z|X, and the role of speculation in settling them is reduced by the use of such techniques as propensity scores, poststratification, testing for overt bias before accepting a poststratification, and optimal full matching. Such beginnings pave the way for ``randomization inference'', an approach which, despite a long history in the analysis of designed experiments, is relatively new to political science and to other fields in which experimental data are rarely available. The approach applies to both experiments and observational studies. We illustrate this by applying it to analyze A. Gerber and D. Green's New Haven Vote 98 campaign. Conceived as both a get-out-the-vote campaign and a field experiment in political participation, the campaign as it turned out was in some ways more similar to an observational study than to a randomized experiment. Our analysis uses the strengths of the design of their study while adjusting for irregularities ignored by the original analysis. We estimate the number of voters who would not have voted had the campaign not prompted them to --- that is, the total number of votes attributable to the interventions of the campaigners. Both our statistical inferences about these attributable effects and the stratification and matching that precede them rely on quite recent developments from statistics; our matching, in particular, has novel features of potentially wide applicability. Our broad findings resemble those of the original analysis by Gerber and Green (2000), although in the small, the method offers additional information as to the campaign's effects upon interestingly different subgroups, such as older voters or those who have not voted in a previous election. },

Our review places special emphasis on assessing the methodological rigor of existing research, calling attention to problems of design and measurement that threaten both internal and external validity. Of the hundreds of studies we examine, a small fraction speak convincingly to the questions of whether, why, and under what conditions a given type of intervention works. We conclude that the causal effects of many widespread prejudice-reduction interventions, such as workplace diversity training and media campaigns, remain unknown. Although some intergroup contact and cooperation interventions appear promising, a much more rigorous and broad-ranging empirical assessment of prejudice-reduction strategies is needed to determine what works.},

Doreen Massey manages to describe a certain way of
perceiving movement in space which I have been - and still
am - working with on different levels in my work: i.e. the
idea that space is not something static and neutral, a
frozen entity, but is something intertwined with time and
thus ever changing - also when we are not occupying it.
Doreen's descriptions of her journey through England for
example are clear and precise accounts of this idea, and
she very sharply characterizes the attempts not to
recognize this idea as utopian and nostalgic." </em><br />-
Olafur Eliasson <p></p><p></p><p>In this book, Doreen
Massey makes an impassioned argument for revitalising our
imagination of space. She takes on some well-established
assumptions from philosophy, and some familiar ways of
characterising the twenty-first century world, and shows
how they restrain our understanding of both the challenge
and the potential of space.</p><p></p><p>The way we think
about space matters. It inflects our understandings of the
world, our attitudes to others, our politics. It affects,
for instance, the way we understand globalisation, the way
we approach cities, the way we develop, and practice, a
sense of place. If time is the dimension of change then
space is the dimension of the social: the contemporaneous
co-existence of others. That is its challenge, and one that
has been persistently evaded. <b>For Space</b> pursues its
argument through philosophical and theoretical engagement,
and through telling personal and political reflection.
Doreen Massey asks questions such as how best to
characterise these so-called spatial times, how it is that
implicit spatial assumptions inflect our politics, and how
we might develop a responsibility for place beyond
place.</p><p></p><p>This book is "for space" in that it
argues for a reinvigoration of the spatiality of our
implicit cosmologies. <b>For Space </b>is essential reading
for anyone interested in space and the spatial turn in the
social sciences and humanities. Serious, and sometimes
irreverent, it is a compelling manifesto: for re-imagining
spaces for these times and facing up to their
challenge.</p>},

@article{Silber1997,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Institutional complication rates are often used to assess hospital quality of care, particularly for conditions and procedures where mortality rates are not useful because deaths are rare. The objective of this study was to assess the correlation among hospital quality assessment rankings based on adjusted mortality, complication and failure-to-rescue rates. DESIGN: This study used a clinically detailed administrative data set to compare severity and case-mix adjusted hospital outcome rankings for three different measures of quality of care: in-hospital death, complication and failure-to-rescue (in-hospital death following a complication). SETTING AND PATIENTS: Analysis of 74,647 patients who underwent general surgical procedures included in the 1991 and 1992 MedisGroups National Comparative Data Base. MEASUREMENTS: Adjusted outcomes of death, complication and failure to rescue based on multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: For 142 hospitals, the correlation between hospital rankings based on the death rate and those ranked by the complication rate was only 0.208 (P = 0.013). A similarly low correlation was present between the complication and failure rate rankings, r = -0.090 (P = 0.287). A higher correlation was observed between the death and failure rate rankings, r = 0.90 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: For general surgical procedures, hospital rank using the complication rate is poorly correlated with rankings using the death or failure rate. Complication rates should be used with great caution and should not be used in isolation when assessing hospital quality of care.},

abstract = {An experimental unit is an opportunity to randomly apply or withhold a treatment. There is interference between units if the application of the treatment to one unit may also affect other units. In cognitive neuroscience, a common form of experiment presents a sequence of stimuli or requests for cognitive activity at random to each experimental subject and measures biological aspects of brain activity that follow these requests. Each subject is then many experimental units, and interference between units within an experimental subject is likely, in part because the stimuli follow one another quickly and in part because human subjects learn or become experienced or primed or bored as the experiment proceeds. We use a recent fMRI experiment concerned with the inhibition of motor activity to illustrate and further develop recently proposed methodology for inference in the presence of interference. A simulation evaluates the power of competing procedures.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to further theoretical and empirical understanding of adherent and constituent mobilization by proposing and analyzing frame alignment as a conceptual bridge linking social psychological and resource mobilization views on movement participation. Extension of Goffman's (1974) frame analytic perspective provides the conceptual/theoretical framework; field research on two religious movements, the peace movement, and several neighborhood movements provide the primary empirical base. Four frame alignment processes are identified and elaborated: frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension, and frame transformation. The basic underlying premise is that frame alignment, of one variety or another, is a necessary condition for participation, whatever its nature or intensity, and that it is typically an interactional and ongoing accomplishment. The paper concludes with an elaboration of several sets of theoretical and research implications.},

abstract = {This paper elaborates statistical models for the analysis of regulatory review deadlines or ``review time goals'' and their influence upon regulatory decisions. We outline two sets of statistical methods for estimating the models. In the first set, dynamic duration models of time to decision are elaborated, with particular focus on semi-parametric methods from which the behavioral structure of a regulatory review can be induced or ``backed out.'' In the second set, we consider different estimators for observational analysis of whether the deadlines in question influence the ``quality'' of the reviews or the likelihood of error. In particular, we consider how to use results from the ``first stage'' (induced behavioral review structure) to test whether deadlines influence the distribution of error. We apply these methods to the imposition of review-time goals by the Prescription Drug User-Fee Act (PDUFA) and its amended successors upon new drug review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Using the first set of methods, we find broad evidence that the deadlines have induced a piling of approvals right before the deadline elapses. Using the second set of methods, we find that these ``pre-deadline'' approvals are subject to substantially different post market experiences than drugs approved either after the deadlines or ``very early'' in the approval process.},

Such utopian thinking is indispensable, and contributing to it is part of sociology's core business. This article illustrates these claims by considering one particular utopian proposal: an unconditional basic income paid to every member of society on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. It summarizes the main arguments that support this proposal, mentions a number of contexts in which it is being taken seriously, and sketches a number of ways in which sociological insights and research are crucially relevant to the discussion of the economic and political sustainability of an unconditional basic income.},

abstract = {In an observational study of treatment effects, subjects are not randomly assigned to treatment or control, so differing outcomes in treated and control groups may reflect a bias from nonrandom assignment rather than a treatment effect. After adjusting for measured pretreatment covariates, perhaps by matching, a sensitivity analysis determines the magnitude of bias from an unmeasured covariate that would need to be present to alter the conclusions of the naive analysis that presumes adjustments eliminated all bias. Other things being equal, larger effects tend to be less sensitive to bias than smaller effects. Effect modification is an interaction between a treatment and a pretreatment covariate controlled by matching, so that the treatment effect is larger at some values of the covariate than at others. In the presence of effect modification, it is possible that results are less sensitive to bias in subgroups experiencing larger effects. Two cases are considered: (i) an a priori grouping into a few categories based on covariates controlled by matching and (ii) a grouping discovered empirically in the data at hand. In case (i), subgroup specific bounds on p-values are combined using the truncated product of p-values. In case (ii), information that is fixed under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect is used to partition matched pairs in the hope of identifying pairs with larger effects. The methods are evaluated using an asymptotic device, the design sensitivity, and using simulation. Sensitivity analysis for a test of the global null hypothesis of no effect is converted to sensitivity analyses for subgroup analyses using closed testing. A study of an intervention to control malaria in Africa is used to illustrate.},

abstract = {Huber's m-estimates use an estimating equation in which observations are permitted a controlled level of influence. The family of m-estimates includes least squares and maximum likelihood, but typical applications give extreme observations limited weight. Maritz proposed methods of exact and approximate permutation inference for m-tests, confidence intervals, and estimators, which can be derived from random assignment of paired subjects to treatment or control. In contrast, in observational studies, where treatments are not randomly assigned, subjects matched for observed covariates may differ in terms of unobserved covariates, so differing outcomes may not be treatment effects. In observational studies, a method of sensitivity analysis is developed for m-tests, m-intervals, and m-estimates: it shows the extent to which inferences would be altered by biases of various magnitudes due to nonrandom treatment assignment. The method is developed for both matched pairs, with one treated subject matched to one control, and for matched sets, with one treated subject matched to one or more controls. The method is illustrated using two studies: (i) a paired study of damage to DNA from exposure to chromium and nickel and (ii) a study with one or two matched controls comparing side effects of two drug regimes to treat tuberculosis. The approach yields sensitivity analyses for: (i) m-tests with Huber's weight function and other robust weight functions, (ii) the permutational t-test which uses the observations directly, and (iii) various other procedures such as the sign test, Noether's test, and the permutation distribution of the efficient score test for a location family of distributions. Permutation inference with covariance adjustment is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {<em>"The reason for my enthusiasm for this book is that Doreen Massey manages to describe a certain way of perceiving movement in space which I have been - and still am - working with on different levels in my work: i.e. the idea that space is not something static and neutral, a frozen entity, but is something intertwined with time and thus ever changing - also when we are not occupying it. Doreen's descriptions of her journey through England for example are clear and precise accounts of this idea, and she very sharply characterizes the attempts not to recognize this idea as utopian and nostalgic." </em><br />- Olafur Eliasson <p></p><p></p><p>In this book, Doreen Massey makes an impassioned argument for revitalising our imagination of space. She takes on some well-established assumptions from philosophy, and some familiar ways of characterising the twenty-first century world, and shows how they restrain our understanding of both the challenge and the potential of space.</p><p></p><p>The way we think about space matters. It inflects our understandings of the world, our attitudes to others, our politics. It affects, for instance, the way we understand globalisation, the way we approach cities, the way we develop, and practice, a sense of place. If time is the dimension of change then space is the dimension of the social: the contemporaneous co-existence of others. That is its challenge, and one that has been persistently evaded. <b>For Space</b> pursues its argument through philosophical and theoretical engagement, and through telling personal and political reflection. Doreen Massey asks questions such as how best to characterise these so-called spatial times, how it is that implicit spatial assumptions inflect our politics, and how we might develop a responsibility for place beyond place.</p><p></p><p>This book is "for space" in that it argues for a reinvigoration of the spatiality of our implicit cosmologies. <b>For Space </b>is essential reading for anyone interested in space and the spatial turn in the social sciences and humanities. Serious, and sometimes irreverent, it is a compelling manifesto: for re-imagining spaces for these times and facing up to their challenge.</p>},

abstract = {This paper offers the data analyst a range of practical procedures for dealing with outliers in multilevel data. It first develops several techniques for data exploration for outliers and outlier analysis and then applies these to the detailed analysis of outliers in two large scale multilevel data sets from educational contexts. The techniques include the use of deviance reduction, measures based on residuals, leverage values, hierarchical cluster analysis and a measure called DFITS. Outlier analysis is more complex in a multilevel data set than in, say, a univariate sample or a set of regression data, where the concept of an outlying value is straightforward. In the multilevel situation one has to consider, for example, at what level or levels a particular response is outlying, and in respect of which explanatory variables; furthermore, the treatment of a particular response at one level may affect its status or the status of other units at other levels in the model.},

Gibson-Graham offer already existing alternatives to a global capitalist order and outline strategies for building alternative economies. <br> <br> <i>A Postcapitalist Politics</i> reveals a prolific landscape of economic diversity---one that is not exclusively or predominantly capitalist---and examines the challenges and successes of alternative economic interventions. Gibson-Graham bring together political economy, feminist poststructuralism, and economic activism to foreground the ethical decisions, as opposed to structural imperatives, that construct economic ``development'' pathways. Marshalling empirical evidence from local economic projects and action research in the United States, Australia, and Asia, they produce a distinctive political imaginary with three intersecting moments: a politics of language, of the subject, and of collective action. In the face of an almost universal sense of surrender to capitalist globalization, this book demonstrates that postcapitalist subjects, economies, and communities can be fostered. The authors describe a politics of possibility that can build different economies in place and over space. They urge us to confront the forces that stand in the way of economic experimentation and to explore different ways of moving from theory to action. <br> <br> J. K. Gibson-Graham is the pen name of Katherine Gibson and Julie Graham, feminist economic geographers who work, respectively, at the Australian National University in Canberra and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</div>},

little attention to the question of how such a model should
be chosen. In the present paper, we consider first what
Fisher and Neyman had to say about this problem and in
Section 2 survey some contributions statistical theory has
made to it. In Section 3 we study a distinction between two

procedure by which linear models for the experimental

Regarding design, we summarize developments in estimates of intraclass correlation, power analysis, matched designs, designs involving one group per condition, and designs in which individuals are randomized to receive treatments in groups. Regarding analysis, we summarize developments in marginal and conditional models, the sandwich estimator, model-based estimators, binary data, survival analysis, randomization tests, survey methods, latent variable methods and nonlinear mixed models, time series methods, global tests for multiple endpoints, mediation effects, missing data, trial reporting, and software. We encourage investigators who conduct GRTs to become familiar with these developments and to collaborate with methodologists who can strengthen the design and analysis of their trials.

abstract = {This paper exploits the emotional connections and viewer attentiveness of mainstream media to evaluate the economic impact of financial education messages on debt management delivered through a popular television soap opera in South Africa. The study uses a symmetric encouragement design to compare outcomes of individuals who were randomly assigned to watch a soap opera with financial messages, “Scandal!” to those of individuals who were invited to watch a similar soap opera without financial messages, “Muvhango.” Both shows overlapped in evening primetime and had similar past viewership profiles. The financial storyline spanned two months and featured one of the leading characters of the show borrowing excessively and irresponsibly through hire-purchase, gambling, and ending up in financial distress; and eventually seeking help to find her way out. Two intermediate and one final follow-up surveys were conducted as part of the study. The analysis finds individuals assigned to watch Scandal had significantly higher financial knowledge of the issues highlighted in the soap opera storyline, in particular messages delivered by the leading character. On behavior, Scandal viewers were almost twice more likely to borrow from formal sources, less likely to engage in gambling, and less prone to enter hire purchase agreements. Messages promoting a national debt mediation helpline delivered by an external character did not sustain traction beyond immediate interest. Three qualitative focus groups highlight the importance of emotional connections with the leading character in motivating behavior change.},

checking that treatment effects appear where they should,
and not elsewhere. For instance, treated and control groups

obtain a confidence set for an unobserved covariate. The
impact of this unobserved covariate is indicated by a
sensitivity analysis with the covariate confined to the
confidence set. In this way, a test for bias may indicate
either the presence and magnitude of a hidden bias or else

abstract = {The familiar logit and probit models provide convenient settings for many binary response applications, but a larger class of link functions may be occasionally desirable. Two parametric families of link functions are investigated: the Gosset link based on the Student t latent variable model with the degrees of freedom parameter controlling the tail behavior, and the Pregibon link based on the (generalized) Tukey ?? family, with two shape parameters controlling skewness and tail behavior. Both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods for estimation and inference are explored, compared and contrasted. In applications, like the propensity score matching problem discussed below, where it is critical to have accurate estimates of the conditional probabilities, we find that misspecification of the link function can create serious bias. Bayesian point estimation via MCMC performs quite competitively with MLE methods; however nominal coverage of Bayes credible regions is somewhat more problematic. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {As the counterfactual model of causality has increased in popularity, sociologists have returned to matching as a research methodology. In this article, advances over the past two decades in matching estimators are explained, and the practical limitations of matching techniques are emphasized. The authors introduce matching methods by focusing first on ideal scenarios in which stratification and weighting procedures warrant causal inference. Then, they discuss how matching is often undertaken in practice, offering an overview of the most prominent data analysis routines. With four hypothetical examples, they demonstrate how the assumptions behind matching estimators often break down in practice. Even so, the authors argue that matching techniques can be used effectively to strengthen the prosecution of causal questions in sociology. },

abstract = {Causal inference in an important topic and one that is now
attracting serious attention of statisticians. Although
there exist recent discussions concerning the general
definition of causal effects and a substantial literature
on specific techniques for the analysis of data in
randomized and nonrandomized studies, there has been
relatively little discussion of modes of statistical
inference for causal effects. This presentation briefly
describes and contrasts four basic modes of statistical
inference for causal effects, emphasizes the common
underlying causal framework with a posited assignment
mechanism, and describes practical implications in the
context of an example involving the effects of switching
from a name-brand to a generic drug. A fundamental
conclusion is that in such nonrandomized studies,
sensitivity of inference to the assignment mechanism is the
dominant issue, and it cannot be avoided by changing modes
of inference, for instance, by changing from
randomization-based to Bayesian methods.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Limitations in duty hours for physicians-in-training in the United States were established by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and implemented on July 1, 2003. The association of these changes with mortality among hospitalized patients has not been well established. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the change in duty hour regulations was associated with relative changes in mortality in hospitals of different teaching intensity within the US Veterans Affairs (VA) system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: An observational study of all unique patients (N = 318 636) admitted to acute-care VA hospitals (N = 131) using interrupted time series analysis with data from July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2005. All patients had principal diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, or stroke or a diagnosis related group classification of general, orthopedic, or vascular surgery. Logistic regression was used to examine the change in mortality for patients in more vs less teaching-intensive hospitals before (academic years 2000-2003) and after (academic years 2003-2005) duty hour reform, adjusting for patient comorbidities, common time trends, and hospital site. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-location mortality within 30 days of hospital admission. RESULTS: In postreform year 1, no significant relative changes in mortality were observed for either medical or surgical patients. In postreform year 2, the odds of mortality decreased significantly in more teaching-intensive hospitals for medical patients only. Comparing a hospital having a resident-to-bed ratio of 1 with a hospital having a resident-to-bed ratio of 0, the odds of mortality were reduced for patients with AMI (odds ratio [OR], 0.48; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.71), for the 4 medical conditions together (OR, 0.74; 95\% CI, 0.61-0.89), and for the 3 medical conditions excluding AMI (OR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.63-0.98). Compared with hospitals in the 25th percentile of teaching intensity, there was an absolute improvement in mortality from prereform year 1 to postreform year 2 of 0.70 percentage points (11.1\% relative decrease) and 0.88 percentage points (13.9\% relative decrease) in hospitals in the 75th and 90th percentile of teaching intensity, respectively, for the combined medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The ACGME duty hour reform was associated with significant relative improvement in mortality for patients with 4 common medical conditions in more teaching-intensive VA hospitals in postreform year 2. No associations were identified for surgical patients.},

Questioning the theoretical centrality of this assumption directs social movement analysis away from its heavy emphasis upon the social psychology of social movement participants; it can then be more easily integrated with structural theories of social process. This essay presents a set of concepts and related propositions drawn from a resource mobilization perspective. It emphasizes the variety and sources of resources; the relationship of social movements to the media, authorities, and other parties; and the interaction among movement organizations. Propositions are developed to explain social movement activity at several levels of inclusiveness-the social movement sector, the social movement industry, and social movement organization.},

@book{Nestle2007Food,
abstract = {In the U.S., we're bombarded with nutritional advice--the work, we assume, of reliable authorities with our best interests at heart. Far from it, says Marion Nestle, whose <I>Food Politics</I> absorbingly details how the food industry--through lobbying, advertising, and the co-opting of experts--influences our dietary choices to our detriment. Central to her argument is the American "paradox of plenty," the recognition that our food abundance (we've enough calories to meet every citizen's needs twice over) leads profit-fixated food producers to do everything possible to broaden their market portion, thus swaying us to eat <I>more</I> when we should do the opposite. The result is compromised health: epidemic obesity to start, and increased vulnerability to heart and lung disease, cancer, and stroke--reversible if the constantly suppressed "eat less, move more" message that most nutritionists shout could be heard. <p> Nestle, nutrition chair at New York University and editor of the 1988 Surgeon General Report, has served her time in the dietary trenches and is ideally suited to revealing how government nutritional advice is watered down when a message might threaten industry sales. (Her report on byzantine nutritional food-pyramid rewordings to avoid "eat less" recommendations is both predictable and astonishing.) She has other "war stories," too, that involve marketing to children in school (in the form of soft-drink "pouring rights" agreements, hallway advertising, and fast-food coupon giveaways), and diet-supplement dramas in which manufacturers and the government enter regulation frays, with the industry championing "free choice" even as that position counters consumer protection. Is there hope? "If we want to encourage people to eat better diets," says Nestle, "we need to target societal means to counter food industry lobbying and marketing practices as well as the education of individuals." It's a telling conclusion in an engrossing and masterfully panoramic expos\'{e}. <I>--Arthur Boehm</I> An accessible and balanced account, <I>Food Politics </I>laid the groundwork for today's food revolution and changed the way we respond to food industry marketing practices. Now, a new introduction and concluding chapter bring us up to date on the key events in that movement. This pathbreaking, prize-winning book helps us understand more clearly than ever before what we eat and why.},

abstract = {When experimental designs are infeasible, researchers must
resort to the use of observational data from surveys,
censuses, and administrative records. Because assignment to
the independent variables of observational data is usually
nonrandom, the challenge of estimating causal effects with
observational data can be formidable. In this chapter, we
review the large literature produced primarily by
statisticians and econometricians in the past two decades
on the estimation of causal effects from observational
data. We first review the now widely accepted
counterfactual framework for the modeling of causal
effects. After examining estimators, both old and new, that
can be used to estimate causal effects from cross-sectional
data, we present estimators that exploit the additional
information furnished by longitudinal data. Because of the
size and technical nature of the literature, we cannot
offer a fully detailed and comprehensive presentation.
Instead, we present only the main features of methods that
are accessible and potentially of use to quantitatively
oriented sociologists.},

For familiar models, the analysis of crude rates with age as a covariate can lead to unbiased estimates, and therefore can be preferable. Several other regression methods are also considered},

abstract = {We develop a new method for blocking in randomized experiments that works for an arbitrary number of treatments. We analyze the following prob- lem: given a threshold for the minimum number of units to be contained in a block, and given a distance measure between any two units in the finite population, block the units so that the maximum distance between any two units within a block is minimized. This blocking criterion can minimize covariate imbalance, which is a common goal in experimental design. Find- ing an optimal blocking is an NP-hard problem. However, using ideas from graph theory, we provide the first polynomial time approximately optimal blocking algorithm for this problem. We derive the variances of estimators for sample average treatment effects under the Neyman-Rubin potential out- comes model for arbitrary blocking assignments and an arbitrary number of treatments.

@article{Rosenbaum1999,
abstract = {In a randomized experiment, the investigator creates a clear and relatively unambiguous comparison of treatment groups by exerting tight control over the assignment of treatments to experimental subjects, ensuring that comparable subjects receive alternative treatments. In an observational study, the investigator lacks control of treatment assignments and must seek a clear comparison in other ways. Care in the choice of circumstances in which the study is conducted can greatly influence the quality of the evidence about treatment effects. This is illustrated in detail using three observational studies that use choice effectively, one each from economics, clinical psychology and epidemiology. Other studies are discussed more briefly to illustrate specific points. The design choices include (i) the choice of research hypothesis, (ii) the choice of treated and control groups, (iii) the explicit use of competing theories, rather than merely null and alternative hypotheses, (iv) the use of internal replication in the form of multiple manipulations of a single dose of treatment, (v) the use of undelivered doses in control groups, (vi) design choices to minimize the need for stability analyses, (vii) the duration of treatment and (viii) the use of natural blocks.

abstract = {Gerber challenges the traditional view that challenger spending is more effective at winning Senate elections than incumbent spending, because when OLS regressions are re-estimated using an instrumental variables such as candidate wealth, he finds that traditional OLS regressions have historically underestimated the effectiveness of incumbent spending. Although most research on campaign spending focuses on challengers rather than incumbents, incumbent spending clearly wins elections, making campaign spending a critical factor in the competitiveness of congressional elections. Spending limits applied to both challengers and incumbents favor those already elected. Therefore limits on campaign spending will only be detrimental to challengers. The author used a reduced form relationship to summarize the mechanism by which spending influences voting, which results in a useful approximation of a complicated process, and that further work is needed in areas such as sources of candidate funds.},

abstract = {Conservation investments are increasingly being implemented through payments for ecosystem services (PES) for the protection and restoration of ecosystem services around the world. Previous studies suggested that social norms have substantial impacts on environmental behaviors of humans, including enrollment of PES programs. However, it is still not well understood how social norms are affected by the design of PES programs and how the evolution of social norms may affect the efficiency of conservation investments. In this paper, we developed an agent-based simulation model to demonstrate the evolution and impacts of social norms on the enrollment of agricultural land in a PES program. We applied the model to land plots that have been enrolled in China's Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) to examine reenrollment in an alternative payment program when the current payments ceased. The study was conducted in Wolong Nature Reserve where several thousand plant and animal species, including giant pandas, may benefit from the reenrollment. We found that over 15\% more GTGP land can be reenrolled at the same payment if social norms were leveraged by allowing more than 10 rounds of interactions among landholders regarding their reenrollment decisions. With only three rounds of interactions, an additional 7.5\% GTGP land was reenrolled at the same payment due to the effects of social norms. In addition, the effects of social norms were largest at intermediate payments and were smaller at much higher or much smaller payments. Even in circumstances where frequent interactions among landholders about their enrollment decisions are not feasible, policy arrangements that divide households into multiple waves for sequential enrollment can enroll over 11\% more land at a given payment level. The approach presented in this paper can be used to improve the efficiency of existing PES programs and many other conservation investments worldwide. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Communities often rely on sanctioning to induce public goods contributions. Past studies focus on how external agencies or peer sanctioning induce cooperation. In this article, we focus instead on the role played by centralized authorities, internal to the community. Combining lab-in-the-field experiments with observational data on 1,541 Ugandan farmers from 50 communities, we demonstrate the positive effect of internal centralized sanctioning authorities on cooperative behavior. We also show that the size of this effect depends on the political process by which authority is granted: subjects electing leaders contribute more to public goods than subjects who were assigned leaders through a lottery. To test the ecological validity of our findings, we relate farmers behavior in the experiment to their level of cooperation in their community organization. We show that deference to authority in the controlled setting predicts cooperative behavior in the farmers natural environment, in which they face a similar social dilemma.},

abstract = {Commitment failure lies at the core of incomplete contract theory, yet its quantitative significance has rarely been assessed. Using detailed plot-level data from rural Pakistan, we find that non-contractible investment is underprovided on tenanted land, even after controlling for the endogeneity of leasing decisions. Our evidence also indicates that moral hazard in investment effort alone cannot explain this inefficiency. Instead, imperfect commitment appears to be the driving mechanism, since even plots taken on fixed rent contracts where all the rent is paid upfront receive lower investment than owner-cultivated plots. We further show that a considerable portion of the variation in tenancy duration, and hence in the security of tenure, is due to heterogeneity across landlords. One interpretation of this finding is that landlord reputation is important in mitigating hold-up.},

Using a new dataset on civil war in Colombia, we find that exogenous price shocks in the coffee and oil markets affect coflict in opposite directions, and through separate channels. A sharp fall in coffee prices during the late 1990s increased violence dispro- portionately in coffee-intensive municipalities, by lowering wages and the opportunity cost of recruitment into armed groups. In contrast, a rise in oil prices increased conflict in the oil region, by expanding local government budgets and raising potential gains from rapacity and predation on these resources. Our analysis suggests that the price of labor intensive goods affect conflict primarily through the opportunity cost effect, while the price of capital intensive goods affect conflict through the rapacity channel.},

This effect suggests that voters are sensitive to whether their compliance with the norm of voting is being monitored. The present study extends this line of research by investigating whether disclosure of past participation has a stronger effect on turnout when it calls attention to a past abstention or a past vote. A sample of 369,211 registered voters who voted in just one of two recent elections were randomly assigned to receive no mail, mail that encouraged them to vote, and mail that both encouraged them to vote and indicated their turnout in one previous election. The latter type of mailing randomly reported either the election in which they voted or the one in which they abstained. Results suggest that mailings dis- closing past voting behavior had strong effects on voter turnout and that these effects were signiﬁcantly enhanced when it disclosed an abstention in a recent election.},

We argue that the Digital Revolution's ultimate impact on development will depend on several key variables, including the extent to which these technologies foster within-country linkages among different sectors and socioeconomic classes; the degree to which new technological applications may be customized or transformed to advance local development; and the outcome of political contests between organized interests that are promoting different ways of organizing and governing the global digital economy. While it is difficult to fully assess a transformation while living in the midst of it, research on the social, political, and economic implications of the Digital Revolution will constitute an important agenda for development scholars in the years to come.

abstract = {This paper uses an n-person public goods experiment with costly retaliation as a way to assess and capture the role of ethnic identifiability in people?s propensity to cooperate or retaliate against each other in ethnically diverse post conflict societies. The experiment is conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina and field sites are selected according to the OSCE survey on educational performance in Bosnian schools and include a range of monoethnic, integrated as well as segregated schools (two-schools under one roof). After conducting game-theoretic analysis given the different parameters of identifiability, social structure and institutions, we derive equilibrium predictions compare them to our experimental results. The experiments are conducted using a double-blind approach and are accompanied by an extended survey of participants, to record demographic information, cultural attitudes, their understanding of the experiment, and further substantive questions on identifiablity as well as preferences for cooperation and retaliation. In addition, we conduct multivariate regression analysis using experimental follow-up surveys, to determine what demographic, attitudinal and personal history characteristics drive the subjects? identifiability, cooperation and retaliation. Through various controls and treatments, the experiment assesses how the structure of society and institutions affects identifiability as well as its role on cooperation or retaliation among members of different ethnic groups. The methodology combines experimental economics with emerging applications of political science field experiments (such as the work of Haburymana, Humphreys, Posner and Weinstein). Using a field experiment to understand how ethnic identifiability relates to incentives for conflict and cooperation, does not only contribute to important theoretical questions across the fields of political economy, behavioral and experimental economics, and political science but also has direct policy implications for how the developed world (the North) can promote post-conflict confidence-building measures that foster trust and encourage the construction of functioning post-conflict states in the developing world (the South). ..PAT.-Conference Proceeding [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

I exploit variation in the identity of soldiers who conducted so-called “sweep” operations (zachistki) in Chechnya (2000–5) as an empirical strategy for testing the link between ethnicity and violence. Evidence suggests that the intensity and timing of insurgent attacks are conditional on who “swept” a particular village. For example, attacks decreased by about 40\% after pro-Russian Chechen sweeps relative to similar Russian- only operations. These changes are difficult to reconcile with notions of Chechen solidarity or different tactical choices. Instead, evidence, albeit tentative, points toward the existence of a wartime “coethnicity advantage.” Chechen soldiers, enmeshed in dense intraethnic networks, are better positioned to identify insurgents within the population and to issue credible threats against civilians for noncooperation. A second mechanism----prior experience as an insurgent----may also be at work. These findings suggest new avenues of research investigating the conditional effects of violence in civil wars.},

@article{Hansen2009,
abstract = {Statistical analysis requires a probability model: commonly, a model for the dependence of outcomes Y on confounders X and a potentially causal variable Z. When the goal of the analysis is to infer Z's effects on Y , this requirement introduces an element of circularity: in order to decide how Z affects Y , the analyst first determines, speculatively, the manner of Y 's dependence on Z and other variables. This paper takes a statistical perspective that avoids such circles, permitting analysis of Z's effects on Y even as the statistician remains entirely agnostic about the conditional distribution of Y given X and Z, or perhaps even denies that such a distribution exists. Our assumptions instead pertain to the conditional distribution Z|X, and the role of speculation in settling them is reduced by the use of such techniques as propensity scores, poststratification, testing for overt bias before accepting a poststratification, and optimal full matching. Such beginnings pave the way for ``randomization inference'', an approach which, despite a long history in the analysis of designed experiments, is relatively new to political science and to other fields in which experimental data are rarely available. The approach applies to both experiments and observational studies. We illustrate this by applying it to analyze A. Gerber and D. Green's New Haven Vote 98 campaign. Conceived as both a get-out-the-vote campaign and a field experiment in political participation, the campaign as it turned out was in some ways more similar to an observational study than to a randomized experiment. Our analysis uses the strengths of the design of their study while adjusting for irregularities ignored by the original analysis. We estimate the number of voters who would not have voted had the campaign not prompted them to --- that is, the total number of votes attributable to the interventions of the campaigners. Both our statistical inferences about these attributable effects and the stratification and matching that precede them rely on quite recent developments from statistics; our matching, in particular, has novel features of potentially wide applicability. Our broad findings resemble those of the original analysis by Gerber and Green (2000), although in the small, the method offers additional information as to the campaign's effects upon interestingly different subgroups, such as older voters or those who have not voted in a previous election. },

abstract = {As of 2007, 29 developing countries had some type of Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program in place, with many others planning or piloting one. However, the evidence base needed by a government to decide how to design a new CCT program is severely limited in a number of critical dimensions. We present one-year schooling impacts from a CCT experiment among teenage girls and young women in Malawi, which was designed to address these shortcomings: conditionality status, size of separate transfers to the schoolgirl and the parent, and village-level saturation of treatment were all independently randomized. We find that the program had large impacts on school attendance: the re-enrollment rate among those who had already dropped out of school before the start of the program increased by two and a half times and the dropout rate among those in school at baseline decreased from 11\% to 6\%. These impacts were, on average, similar in the conditional and the unconditional treatment arms. While most schooling outcomes examined here were unresponsive to variation in the size of the transfer to the parents, higher transfers given directly to the schoolgirls were associated with significantly improved school attendance and progress – but only if the transfers were conditional on school attendance. We find no spillover effects within treatment communities after the first year of program implementation. Policymakers looking to design cost-effective cash transfer programs targeted towards young women should note the relative insensitivity of these short-term program impacts with respect to conditionality and total transfer size.},

Using a large-scale randomized field experiment in Afghanistan, we explore whether the inclusion of villages in the country’s largest development program alters perceptions of well-being, attitudes towards the government, and levels of security in surrounding areas. We find that the program has a positive effect on all three measures in relatively secure regions, but no effect on attitudes and security in areas with high levels of initial violence, suggesting that a certain minimum threshold of security has to be in place for the provision of goods and services to have an effect on improving attitudes towards the government and reducing violence.},

In the 1980s, growing wage dispersion is due to changes in the institutions of the labor market. Declining unionization and declines in the level at which wages are bargained collectively both contribute to widening pay dispersion in the 1980s. In the 1990s, by contrast, increases in pay inequality are due to increasing trade with less developed nations. To the extent that low-pay workers have been protected from rising wage differentials in the 1990s, it has been because of government policy, in the form of social insurance, and not thanks to labor organizations. This is the first study to report that the causes for pay inequality differed between the 1980s and the 1990s.},

abstract = {Education policy has recently focused on improving accountability and incentives of public providers for actual learning outcomes, often with school-based reward programmes for high performers. The Learning Guarantee Programme in Karnataka, India, is prominent among such efforts, providing cash transfers to government schools that achieve learning at specified high levels. This study examines whether schools that self-selected into the incentive programme are different than those that did not. The answer has important implications for how to evaluate the impact of such a programme. Although we find no significant differences in resources and characteristics, we do find significant and substantial differences in test scores prior to selection into the programme, with better performing schools more likely to opt-in. These findings also provide insight into how incentive-based programmes that focus on levels of (rather than changes in) achievement can exacerbate inequality in education. Failing schools, since they are more likely to opt-out of incentive programmes, are likely to require other targeted programmes in order to improve. In addition, our findings reinforce the value of randomised controlled trials to evaluate incentive programmes since evaluations that rely on matching schools based on resources (if, for instance, pre-programme test scores are unavailable) will be biased if resources poorly predict test scores.},

More generally, how do international norms develop in the absence of incentives for cooperation or activism by norm entrepreneurs? Motivated by the case of election observation, I argue that international norms can be generated through a diffusely motivated signaling process. Responding to increased benefits associated with being democratic, international election observation was initiated by democratizing governments as a signal of a government's commitment to democracy. Increased democracy-contingent benefits gave other “true-democrats” the incentive to invite observers, resulting in a widespread belief that all true-democrats invite election monitors. Consequently, not inviting observers became an unambiguous signal that a government was not democratizing, giving even pseudo-democrats reason to invite observers and risk a negative report. I evaluate this theory with an original global dataset on elections and election observation, 1960–2006.},

abstract = {Experimenters often use post-stratification to adjust estimates. Post-stratification is akin to blocking, except that the number of treated units in each stratum is a random variable because stratification occurs after treatment assignment. We analyse both post-stratification and blocking under the Neyman–Rubin model and compare the efficiency of these designs.We derive the variances for a post-stratified estimator and a simple difference-in-means estimator under different randomization schemes. Post-stratification is nearly as efficient as blocking: the difference in their variances is of the order of 1=n2, with a constant depending on treatment proportion. Post-stratification is therefore a reasonable alternative to blocking when blocking is not feasible. However, in finite samples, post-stratification can increase variance if the number of strata is large and the strata are poorly chosen.To examine why the estimators’ variances are different, we extend our results by conditioning on the observed number of treated units in each stratum. Conditioning also provides more accurate variance estimates because it takes into account how close (or far) a realized random sample is from a comparable blocked experiment. We then show that the practical substance of our results remains under an infinite popula- tion sampling model. Finally, we provide an analysis of an actual experiment to illustrate our analytical results.},

However, for a number of practical reasons, researchers are sometimes unable to conduct experiments and must rely on observational data. In an effort to develop estimators that can approximate experimental results using observational data, scholars have given increasing attention to matching. In this article, we test the performance of matching by gauging the success with which matching approximates experimental results. The voter mobilization experiment presented here comprises a large number of observations (60,000 randomly assigned to the treatment group and nearly two million assigned to the control group) and a rich set of covariates. This study is analyzed in two ways. The first method, instrumental variables estimation, takes advantage of random assignment in order to produce consistent estimates. The second method, matching estimation, ignores random assignment and analyzes the data as though they were nonexperimental. Matching is found to produce biased results in this application because even a rich set of covariates is insufficient to control for preexisting differences between the treatment and control group. Matching, in fact, produces estimates that are no more accurate than those generated by ordinary least squares regression. The experimental findings show that brief paid get-out-the-vote phone calls do not increase turnout, while matching and regression show a large and significant effect.},

I argue that this difference stems from the different sizes of the Chewa and Tumbuka communities in each country relative to each country's national political arena. In Malawi, Chewas and Tumbukas are each large groups vis-\`{a}-vis the country as a whole and, thus, serve as viable bases for political coalition-building. In Zambia, Chewas and Tumbukas are small relative to the country as a whole and, thus, not useful to mobilize as bases of political support.

abstract = {Conservation investments are increasingly being implemented through payments for ecosystem services (PES) for the protection and restoration of ecosystem services around the world. Previous studies suggested that social norms have substantial impacts on environmental behaviors of humans, including enrollment of PES programs. However, it is still not well understood how social norms are affected by the design of PES programs and how the evolution of social norms may affect the efficiency of conservation investments. In this paper, we developed an agent-based simulation model to demonstrate the evolution and impacts of social norms on the enrollment of agricultural land in a PES program. We applied the model to land plots that have been enrolled in China's Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) to examine reenrollment in an alternative payment program when the current payments ceased. The study was conducted in Wolong Nature Reserve where several thousand plant and animal species, including giant pandas, may benefit from the reenrollment. We found that over 15\% more GTGP land can be reenrolled at the same payment if social norms were leveraged by allowing more than 10 rounds of interactions among landholders regarding their reenrollment decisions. With only three rounds of interactions, an additional 7.5\% GTGP land was reenrolled at the same payment due to the effects of social norms. In addition, the effects of social norms were largest at intermediate payments and were smaller at much higher or much smaller payments. Even in circumstances where frequent interactions among landholders about their enrollment decisions are not feasible, policy arrangements that divide households into multiple waves for sequential enrollment can enroll over 11\% more land at a given payment level. The approach presented in this paper can be used to improve the efficiency of existing PES programs and many other conservation investments worldwide. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A growing body of work suggests that exposure to subtle racial cues prompts white voters to penalize black candidates, and that the effects of these cues may influence outcomes indirectly via perceptions of candidate ideology. We test hypotheses related to these ideas using two experiments based on national samples. In one experiment, we manipulated the race of a candidate (Barack Obama vs. John Edwards) accused of sexual impropriety. We found that while both candidates suffered from the accusation, the scandal led respondents to view Obama as more liberal than Edwards, especially among resentful and engaged whites. Second, overall evaluations of Obama declined more sharply than for Edwards. In the other experiment, we manipulated the explicitness of the scandal, and found that implicit cues were more damaging for Obama than explicit ones.

They argue that support for war hinges on initial support for military action and the belief in the success of the war. In this review, we take a critical and constructive view of their work, focusing on methodological concerns. We discuss the dependent variable used by the authors—individual casualty tolerance—and argue that it is an insufficient measure of war support. We also make the case that their independent variables of interest—initial support for war and evaluation of war success—may, in fact, be best understood as indicators of latent support for the war more generally. Finally, we discuss the need for more research into the determinants of support for war, focusing on core values and elite rhetoric as potential variables for continued and future study.},

Our results suggest that this hypothesis is correct. Firms exposed to a shock to their bribe schedules by a change in governor invest significantly less in subsequent periods, as they wait for new information about their new chief executive. Furthermore, the amount of corruption (both measured by survey data and proxied by the number of commercial sex workers) is significantly lower in provinces with new governors.

abstract = {Vote-buying has and continues to be pervasive in many electoral regimes. Yet the relationship between vote-buying and citizen behavior, particularly in the context of the secret ballot, remains largely unknown. In this paper I study vote-buying’s effect on voter turnout in Kenya, using a nationally representative survey that includes questions about the country's 2002 presidential and parliamentary elections. Estimating the causal effect of vote-buying on voter turnout is complicated by the strategic nature of vote-buying, and so this study also examines the strategic logic of vote-buying in Kenya. The results suggest that poor individuals and “swing” voters in the country's most electorally competitive districts are most likely to be targeted by vote-buyers. Using these results, I use probit statistical models as well as propensity score matching and estimate that individuals who were approached by a vote-buyer were about 14 percentage points more likely to vote than those who were not, while the least educated individuals were the most highly influenced by vote-buying. These results are puzzling. If voting is secret and voluntary, why does vote-buying have an impact on individual behavior? I propose and test the empirical implications of two potential explanations: a monitoring and punishment mechanism, and a credibility signaling mechanism. The evidence is tentatively consistent with the monitoring and punishment mechanism, and is also consistent with the credibility signaling mechanism. I conclude with discussion of the study's implications for theories of vote-buying and for the quality of democracy and political accountability in settings where vote-buying is commonplace.},

abstract = {One of the most noted phenomena in social and political decision- making is the occurrence of a framing effect. For example, on problems involving risky choices, individuals tend to act risk-averse when the problem is framed in terms of gains (e.g., saving lives, making money) and risk-seeking when the same problem is instead framed in terms of losses (e.g., deaths, losing money). Scholars have begun to identify the processes underlying framing effects as well as the conditions under which framing effects occur. Yet, extant work focuses nearly exclusively on cognitive processes, despite growing recognition of the importance of emotion in general decision-making tasks. In this paper, we explore the impact of emotional states on risk attitudes and framing. We find that emotions significantly influence both individuals’ tendencies to take risks and the impact of a frame on risky choices (e.g., emotions amplify or depress a frame’s impact). The precise role of emotions depends on the problem domain (e.g., a life-death or a financial deci- sion), and the specific type of emotion under study. Moreover, in contrast to much work in political science, we show that emotions need to be distinguished beyond their positive or negative valence, as different negative emotions exert opposite effects. Our results accentuate the importance of integrating emotions into research areas traditionally dominated by more cognitive perspectives.},

Drawing upon geographically disaggregated data for the period 2000-09, we observe higher line losses just prior to the 2002 and 2007 state elections. Our analysis shows that the incumbent party was more likely to retain the assembly seat as line losses in the locality increased.

Yet one should question this finding, for two reasons. First, existing studies overwhelmingly adopt no-variance research designs that only examine democracies, leaving them unable to assess their performance relative to autocracies. Second, these studies do not control for confounding factors that bias causal estimates. Democracies, for example, typically fight wars of choice as external occupiers, while most autocracies face home-grown insurgencies, a function in part of divergent levels of state capacity possessed by democratic and autocratic combatants. This study corrects for both problems using a new dataset of insurgencies (1800-2005) and matching to test whether democracies experience significantly higher rates of defeat and shorter wars.

Insufficient deference to authority may incapacitate government, whereas too muchmay allowleaders to orchestrate mass violence. Although cross-national and cross-temporal variation in deference to authority and willingness to express dissent has long been studied in political science, rarely have scholars studied programs designed to change these aspects of political culture. This study, situated in post-genocide Rwanda, reports aqualitative and quantitative assessment of one such attempt, a radio program aimed at discouraging blind obedience and reliance on direction from authorities and promoting independent thought and collective action in problem solving. Over the course of one year, this radio program or a comparable program dealing with HIV was randomly presented to pairs of communities, including communities of genocide survivors, Twa people, and imprisoned g´ enocidaires. Changes in individual attitudes, perceived community norms, and deliberative behaviors were assessed using closed-ended interviews, focus group discussions, role-play exercises, and unobtrusive measures of collective decision making. Although the radio program had little effect on many kinds of beliefs and attitudes, it had a substantial impact on listeners’ willingness to express dissent and the ways they resolved communal problems.},

We conduct the first systematic analysis of one determinant of constituency service, voter attachment to political parties, holding constant electoral and political institutions. Our analysis takes advantage of data from a unique type of public spending program that is proliferating across developing countries, the constituency development fund (CDF), which offers more precise measures of legislator effort than are common in the literature. Examining the CDF in India, we find that legislator effort is significantly lower in constituencies that are party strongholds. This result, which is robust to controls for alternate explanations, implies that legislators pass on pork when voters are more attached to political parties.

abstract = {Democratic consolidation depends on common perceptions of institutional legitimacy among citizens aligned with governing and opposition parties. Elections always result in winners and losers, but if they also create subservient insiders and aggrieved outsiders, the future of the democratic system will be uncertain. This article theorizes about why certain electoral qualities (elections that produce turnovers, are peaceful, accepted by opposition parties, and free and fair) should reduce winner-loser gaps in perceived institutional legitimacy. The hypotheses are tested using a hierarchical two-step statistical procedure to analyze three rounds of Afrobarometer microlevel data combined with national-level data on African elections between 1989 and 2006.

@article{Bussell2010,
abstract = {The emergence of new information and communication technologies in the 1990s offered governments opportunities to deliver public services more effectively to their citizens. Yet national and subnational authorities have employed such technologies in highly uneven ways. Drawing on a new data set of technology policy adoption by Indian states, the author argues that political calculations drive variation in the timing and scope of technology policies. Politicians weigh the expected electoral benefits from providing new goods to citizens against the expected electoral costs of reduced access to corrupt funds because of increased transparency. The author shows that the level of bureaucratic corruption in a state is the best predictor of both when states implement policies promoting computer-enabled services and the number of services made available. This finding contrasts with arguments that posit economic or developmental conditions, or alternative electoral and institutional characteristics, as the major drivers of technology investment.},

And yet nearly all empirical analyses using these data aggregate to the country-year level, thereby losing project-specific information. In this paper, we introduce new data on the geographic location of aid projects that have been committed to many African countries between 1989 and 2008. The data enable an examination of project-level information in a wider variety of systematic research contexts. To demonstrate the utility of the new data, we discuss how geographically disaggregated foreign aid and armed conflict data are needed to capture the theoretical mechanisms in the aid-conflict literature. We then map the disaggregated aid and conflict data in Sierra Leone, Angola, and Mozambique as specific examples of how these data could help disentangle competing causal mechanisms linking aid to conflict onset and dynamics. The research provides an important new perspective on the connections between aid and conflict. More generally, it is a crucial first step in geo-referencing and comparing foreign aid projects to various localized development outcomes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, the fragmented media environment also gives television viewers ample opportunities to tune out news outlets with which they disagree as well as the news altogether, and this should moderate oppositional media hostility. We investigate the effects of partisan news shows on media perceptions across six laboratory-based experiments. We find that counterattitudinal news programming is more likely to induce hostile media perceptions than proattitudinal programming, but that the presence of choice blunts oppositional media hostility.

As others have noted, party identification appears to be highly stable once measurement error is taken into account. This seems to be in conflict with recent models that claim to demonstrate the responsiveness of partisanship to short-term political forces. Using data from the 1980 National Election Study Major Panel, we demonstrate that when measurement error is included explicitly in models of political behavior, the effects of performance evaluations, candidate evaluations, issue proximities, or vote choices on party identification are negligible. Thus, it appears that the findings that show a significant impact of these short-term forces on partisanship represent artifacts of inadequate measurement model specification.

We present a considerable body of experimental research supporting the inequality aversion motive. Binmore and Shaked also urge experimentalists to adopt "a more skeptical attitude when far-reaching claims about human behavior are extrapolated from very slender data." It is true that experimental findings indicate that the standard neoclassical model fails to predict a considerable range of strategic behaviors widely observed in the laboratory, particularly under conditions where normative behavior is prevalent in every-day social life. This is indeed a "far-reaching claim," but one amply justified by an impressive and constantly growing body of evidence from experiments. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Where the legislature is weak and politics is clientelistic, democratization of candidate selection is driven by local party members seeking benefits from primary contestants. Analysis of an original dataset on legislative nominations and political interference by party leaders for the 2004 and 2008 elections in Ghana shows that primaries are more common where nominations attract more aspirants and where the party is more likely to win, counter to predictions in the existing literature. Moreover, the analysis shows that party leaders interfere in primaries in a pattern consistent with anticipation of party members’ reactions.},

Specifically, are there ‘group interests’ for AIDS-related policies, and are they represented by political leaders? One might expect all politicians to prioritize a response to the global pandemic as a matter of public interest, especially in high prevalence countries. Alternatively, because recognizable sub-groups are affected differently, theories of representation imply that leader preferences should vary along these lines. The author explores the local political representation of AIDS-related interests within the context of the high prevalence, heterogeneous, and democratic society of South Africa. Through analysis of an original survey of the attitudes and preferences of local cancillors in Eastern Cape Province, he found that descriptive representation is associated with substantive representation: politicians express AIDS policy pre...},

abstract = {Persistent, widespread harassment in schools can be understood as a product of collective school norms that deem harassment, and behavior allowing harassment to escalate, as typical and even desirable. Thus, one approach to reducing harassment is to change students' perceptions of these collective norms. Theory suggests that the public behavior of highly connected and chronically salient actors in a group, called social referents, may provide influential cues for individuals' perception of collective norms. Using repeated, complete social network surveys of a public high school, we demonstrate that changing the public behavior of a randomly assigned subset of student social referents changes their peers' perceptions of school collective norms and their harassment behavior. Social referents exert their influence over peers' perceptions of collective norms through the mechanism of everyday social interaction, particularly interaction that is frequent and personally motivated, in contrast to interaction shaped by institutional channels like shared classes. These findings clarify the development of collective social norms: They depend on certain patterns of and motivations for social interactions within groups across time, and are not static but constantly reshaped and reproduced through these interactions. Understanding this process creates opportunities for changing collective norms and behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {This paper explores the conditions under which cultural cleavages become politically salient. It does so by taking advantage of the natural experiment afforded by the division of the Chewa and Tumbuka peoples by the border between Zambia and Malawi. I document that, while the objective cultural differences between Chewas and Tumbukas on both sides of the border are identical, the political salience of the division between these communities is altogether different. I argue that this difference stems from the different sizes of the Chewa and Tumbuka communities in each country relative to each country's national political arena. In Malawi, Chewas and Tumbukas are each large groups vis-\`{a}-vis the country as a whole and, thus, serve as viable bases for political coalition-building. In Zambia, Chewas and Tumbukas are small relative to the country as a whole and, thus, not useful to mobilize as bases of political support. The analysis suggests that the political salience of a cultural cleavage depends not on the nature of the cleavage itself (since it is identical in both countries) but on the sizes of the groups it defines and whether or not they will be useful vehicles for political competition.},

Firms now opposed protection because they had developed extensive ties to the international economy through exports, multinational production, and global intrafirm trade. The development of these international ties by the 1970s reduced protectionist pressure by American firms even when they were faced with serious import competition: protection had become too costly. The preferences of these firms also seemed to affect trade policy outcomes, turning them away from protection.},

We use endorsement experiments to indirectly elicit truthful answers to sensitive questions about support for different combatants. We demonstrate that civilian attitudes are asymmetric in nature. Harm inflicted by the International Secu- rity Assistance Force (ISAF) is met with reduced support for ISAF and increased support for the Tal- iban, but Taliban-inflicted harm does not translate into greater ISAF support.

abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

Researchers can then estimate the probability that a specific observation is consistent with each rival theory. By modeling this probability with covariates, one can also explore the conditions under which a particular theory applies.

abstract = {An influential literature has demonstrated that legislative transparency can improve the performance of parliamentarians in democracies. In a democracy, the incentive for improved performance is created by voters’ responses to newly available information. Building on this work, donor projects have begun to export transparency interventions to authoritarian regimes under the assumption that nongovernmental organizations and the media can substitute for the incentives created by voters. Such interventions, however, are at odds with an emerging literature that argues that authoritarian parliaments primarily serve the role of co-optation and limited power sharing, where complaints can be raised in a manner that does not threaten regime stability. We argue that under these conditions, transparency may have perverse effects, and we test this theory with a randomized experiment on delegate behavior in query sessions in Vietnam, a single-party authoritarian regime. We find no evidence of a direct effect of the transparency treatment on delegate performance; however, further analysis reveals that delegates subjected to high treatment intensity demonstrate robust evidence of curtailed participation and damaged reelection prospects. These results make us cautious about the export of transparency without electoral sanctioning.},

This is because they are constructed from enumerations of ethnic groups that include all of the ethnographically distinct groups in a country irrespective of whether or not they engage in the political competition whose effects on macroeconomic policymaking are being tested. I present a new index of ethnic fractionalization based on an accounting of politically relevant ethnic groups in 42 African countries. I employ this measure (called \{PREG\}, for Politically Relevant Ethnic Groups) to replicate Easterly and Levine's influential article on Africa's “growth tragedy.” I find that \{PREG\} does a much better job of accounting for the policy-mediated effects of ethnic diversity on economic growth in Africa than does \{ELF\}.},

This book presents a theory that accounts for the different strategies pursued by rebel groups in civil war, explain- ing why patterns of insurgent violence vary so much across conflicts. It does so by examining the membership, structure, and behavior of four insurgent movements in Uganda, Mozambique, and Peru. Drawing on interviews with nearly two hundred combatants and civilians who experienced violence first- hand, it shows that rebels’ strategies depend in important ways on how difficult it is to launch a rebellion. The book thus demonstrates how characteristics of the environment in which rebellions emerge constrain rebel organization and shape},

abstract = {This paper tests the hypothesis that increasing stocks of foreign direct investment (FDI) can lead to de facto decentralization in the form of autonomous reform experiments by subnational leaders. Because these reform experiments may attract FDI in subsequent years, there is a possibility of endogeneity. As a result, the methodology is a simultaneous equation model of 61 Vietnamese provinces between 1990 and 2000. Stocks of FDI as a percentage of GDP are regressed on a measure of autonomy derived from a content analysis of Vietnamese stateowned newspapers. Every time a province is cited in the papers for violating central laws on economic policy by engaging in reform experimentation, it is coded as a case of autonomy. The central question of the analysis is: how much FDI is needed for a province to believe it has the bargaining power to challenge central authority for the first time in a given year? Using this approach, I find strong evidence for the influence of FDI on local autonomous economic reform experiments.},

We find some support for all of the competing theories, suggesting that the rivalry between them is artificial and that theoretical work has insufficiently explored the interaction of various recruitment strategies. At the same time, the empirical results challenge standard interpretations of grievance-based accounts of participation, as poverty, a lack of access to education, and political alienation predict participation in both rebellion and counterrebellion. Factors that are traditionally seen as indicators of grievance or frustration may instead proxy a for more general susceptibility to engage in violent action or a greater vulnerability to political manipulation by elites.},

Th ey express a concern that superfi cial commitments to open data “can placate the public’s appetite for transparency.” Drawing on our experiences with the Kenya Open Data Initiative and the Open Government Partnership, we argue that this need not be the case for three reasons. First, a commitment to open data involves reorienting the production of information in a public bureaucracy in ways that have the potential to institutionalize a commitment to openness. Second, an open data campaign can accelerate demand for information and generate a public conversation about what kind of data matter for accountability. Finally, the two movements may be stronger together. Th e open data movement helps open government advocates focus on the end user’s needs and the possibilities of new technologies, while open government campaigners challenge open data advocates to focus on how transparency and technology can be leveraged for civic accountability. While it is too early to tell how these movements will play out, we believe that bringing these movements under the same big tent, coherently aligning their strategies, goals, and priorities, might ultimately be helpful for citizens interested in promoting openness in their own countries},

In the second part of the paper we present four structural reasons why these problems arise: (i) the ongoing transition from health sector dominated by the public sector, towards a more mixed model; (ii) the failure of government policies to keep pace with the transition towards a mixed model of service delivery; (iii) weak accountability mechanisms and the erosion of professional norms in the health sector; and (iv) the impact of HIV/AIDS. The discussions underline the need to base policies on a micro-analysis of how health workers make constrained choices, both in their career and in their day to day professional activities.},

But many goods that politicians deliver to voters are locally nonexcludable in rural areas, so the local presence of an ethnic group associated with a politician should affect a rural voter's assessment of how likely she is to benefit from that politician's election. Using geocoded polling-station–level election results alongside survey data from Ghana, we show that otherwise similar voters are less likely to vote for the party of their own ethnic group, and more likely to support a party associated with another group, when the local ethnic geography favors the other group. This result helps account for the imperfect correlation between ethnicity and vote choice in African democracies. More generally, this demonstrates how local community and geographic contexts can modify the information conveyed by ethnicity and influence voter behavior.},

As the distinguished contributors to "Grasping the Nettle" make plain, this is not a rhetorical question. Unyielding conflicts offer numerous insights not only about the sources of intractability but also about such facets of mediation and conflict management as how to gain leverage, when to engage and disengage, how to balance competing goals, and who to enlist to play supporting roles.The first part of this eye-opening volume identifies and analyzes the defining characteristics and underlying dynamics of intractable conflicts. The second part turns the spotlight on no fewer than eight current cases, in each instance chronicling the conflict's evolution, evaluating the internal and external factors that have conspired to prevent a settlement, and assessing whether past peacemaking initiatives have in fact only aggravated the conflict. The conclusion makes the point that even intractable conflicts eventually end and highlights the strategic approaches and tactical steps that have yielded success in the past for mediators and conflict managers from governments, international organizations, and NGOs."},

Either approach places the population at the center of a struggle between the government and violent dissidents. Despite numerous works emphasizing either ‘attrition’ or ‘hearts and minds’, few theoretical studies have attempted to compare their relative success. Using an agent-based computational model, we examine which approach is more successful at quelling insurgencies and find that a hearts and minds approach is superior to an attrition strategy.

I ask why state governments in India vary in the number and type of services they offer to citizens through technology-enabled citizen service centers. I argue that politicians estimate the expected electoral benefits from providing improved services to citizens and weigh these benefits against the costs of increased government transparency and associated reductions in corrupt income. Politicians then design service center policies to maximize their chances of retaining power. Because levels of corruption and the characteristics of electoral competition vary across the Indian states, we see related variations in technology policies. These variations in policy, and in particular the services made available to citizens, have important effects on who benefits from citizen service centers. I use evidence from sixteen Indian states to test these arguments, and show that the character of the ruling government and the level of state corruption are robust predictors of variation in state-level technology policies.},

We suggest that the microlinkages between social capital and good government in Making Democracy Work are underspecified and we present four models of how social cooperation at the level of the community translates into good performance at the level of political institutions. We identify the absence of political conflict as a peculiar feature of Putnam's account of Italian politics and history, and we explore the implications of its absence for the theoretical conclusions Putnam reaches and the generalizability of the findings he presents. We examine the relationship between social capital and economic performance and show why Putnam's work has important contributions to make to this field. Finally, we explain why Putnam's findings may not travel well outside of the Italian regions he studies.},

abstract = {This paper uses publicly released audit reports to study the effects of disclos- ing information about corruption practices on electoral accountability. In 2003, as part of an anticorruption program,Brazil’s federal government began to selectmu- nicipalities at random to audit their expenditures of federally transferred funds. The findings of these audits were then made publicly available and disseminated to media sources. Using a data set on corruption constructed from the audit re- ports, we compare the electoral outcomes of municipalities audited before versus after the 2004 elections, with the same levels of reported corruption.We show that the release of the audit outcomes had a significant impact on incumbents’ elec- toral performance, and that these effects were more pronounced in municipalities where local radio was present to divulge the information. Our findings highlight the value of having a more informed electorate and the role played by local media in enhancing political selection.},

abstract = {African leaders are widely presumed to favor members of their own ethnic groups with patronage resources. We assess the empirical validity of this claim by studying ethnic favoritism in the education sector in Kenya. We use data on the educational attainment of more than fifty thousand Kenyans dating back to the colonial era, as well as information about the ethnic identities of Kenyan presidents, cabinet members, and high-level education bureaucrats since independence. We find that having a coethnic as president during one’s primary school-age years is associated with about a one-quarter of a year increase in years of primary schooling with and substantial increases in the probability of attending and completing both primary and secondary school. We also find that ethnic favoritism extends beyond the president: coethnics of the minister of education also acquire more schooling than children from other ethnic groups. In contrast to the findings of some recent studies, we find that multiparty political competition has no impact on the degree of ethnic favoritism by presidents and ministers of education. Nor has ethnic favoritism in the education sector varied across Kenya’s presidents. However, we find that the effect of the entire cabinet’s ethnic composition does vary over time: having more coethnics in the cabinet impacts educational attainment during the multiparty era during the tenure of a president of a relatively small ethnic group, which we suggest may have generated incentives to allocate more discretion over resources to ministers from other ethnic communities and which may have induced these ministers to be more redistributive with their spoils from office. Having established the role of ethnic favoritism in educational outcomes, we identify and provide suggestive evidence about the possible mechanisms explaining these patterns. We also highlight the substantive importance of ethnic favoritism by comparing our estimated effects to those estimated in studies of policy interventions designed to increase educational achievement in the developing world and by estimating the long-term impact of ethnic favoritism through education on a number of long-term socio-economic outcomes.},

abstract = {The game theoretic study of coalitions focuses on settings in which commitment technologies are available to allow groups to coordinate their actions. Analyses of such settings focus on two questions. First, what are the implications of the ability to make commitments and form coalitions for how games are played? Second, given that coalitions can form, which coalitions should we expect to see forming? I examine classic cooperative and new noncooperative game theoretic approaches to answering these questions. Classic approaches have focused especially on the first question and have produced powerful results. However, these approaches suffer from a number of weaknesses. New work attempts to address these shortcomings by modeling coalition formation as an explicitly noncooperative process. This new research reintroduces the problem of coalitional instability characteristic of cooperative approaches, but in a dynamic setting. Although in some settings, classic solutions are recovered, in others this new work shows that outcomes are highly sensitive, not only to bargaining protocols, but also to the forms of commitment that can be externally enforced. This point of variation is largely ignored in empirical research on coalition formation. I close by describing new agendas in coalitional analysis that are being opened up by this new approach.},

Small-N analyses can be used to assess the plausibility of observed statistical relationships between variables, to generate theoretical insights from outlier and other cases, and to develop better measurement strategies.

Expanding the days on which Get Out the Vote (GOTV) activities take place would make conducting labor intensive canvassing campaigns much easier to administer.

Based on recent empirical evidence of post-civil war democratization in El Salvador, Mozambique, and elsewhere, I show that democracy can arise directly from anarchy. Predatory warring factions choose the citizenry and democratic procedures over a Leviathan when (1) their economic interests depend on productive investment by the citizens, (2) citizens’ political preferences ensure that power allocation will be less biased under democracy than under a Leviathan, and (3) there is an external agency (e.g., the United Nations) that mediates and supervises joint disarmament and state-building.

This article argues that an international-level change affected domestic trade politics and contributed to the maintenance of a liberal trading system. Examining the United States and France, the argument proceeds in two steps, showing first how domestic trade politics were changed and second how this change affected the policy process. Initially, I argue that aspects of the increased international economic interdependence of the postwar period altered domestic trade politics by creating new, anti-protectionist preferences among certain firms. Firms with extensive international ties through exports, multinational production, and global intra-firm trade have come to oppose protectionism, since it is very costly for them. Evidence for these new preferences was apparent among both American and French industries. Despite different contexts, firms in the two countries reacted similarly to the growth of interdependence. Next, I ask whether firms' preferences affected trade policy outcomes and show how these preferences were integrated into the policy process in both countries. Trade policy structures in neither country prevented firms' preferences from affecting the policies adopted. Even in France, a so-called "strong" state, firms' preferences were a key influence on policy. In the trade policy area then, the French and American states did not appear to differ greatly in their susceptibility to industry influence, even though their policy processes were different.},

abstract = {One of the greatest threats to the peaceful resolution of civil wars comes from "spoilers," leaders and factions who use violent or nonviolent strategies to alter the course and outcome of a peace process. Spoilers have successfully wrecked peace agreements in contexts as diverse as Rwanda, Angola, Northern Ireland, and Bosnia. This dissertation addresses the questions: (1) under what conditions do individual groups use spoiling strategies that risk derailing the peace process and (2) what are the aggregate effects of spoiling behavior on the process as a whole. I argue that to understand spoiler behavior, its causes and effects over the course of an interdependent three-stage peace process need to be examined. In particular, groups must choose whether to spoil decisions to negotiate, peace agreements, and the implementation of those agreements. Changing incentives to spoil are rooted in the capability and opportunity structure that groups face at each of these stages. These incentives influence individual group behavior (to spoil or cooperate), which; in turn, affects the outcome of the peace process (is peace achieved, or is there a return to war?). Because of the complexities of civil wars (e.g., multiple factions, multiple stages, path dependencies, and extreme uncertainty), I use an agent-based computational model to generate hypotheses about spoiling behavior. The hypotheses are tested using data on all civil wars between 1945-1999, and with case studies of the Bosnia and Rhodesia/Zimbabwe civil wars. Empirical tests support many of the theoretical propositions and show that spoiling behavior occurs throughout peace processes often motivated by different factors, and having different effects, depending on the stage of the process.},

abstract = {The analysis of a baseline predictor with a longitudinally measured outcome is well established and sample size calculations are reasonably well understood. Analysis of bivariate longitudinally measured outcomes is gaining in popularity and methods to address design issues are required. The focus in a random effects model for bivariate longitudinal outcomes is on the correlations that arise between the random effects and between the bivariate residuals. In the bivariate random effects model, we estimate the asymptotic variances of the correlations and we propose power calculations for testing and estimating the correlations. We compare asymptotic variance estimates to variance estimates obtained from simulation studies and compare our proposed power calculations for correlations on bivariate longitudinal data to power calculations for correlations on cross-sectional data.

abstract = {In revisiting the influential Dyson and Moore (1983) hypothesis as to why women in South India enjoy relatively more agency than in the North, we conducted an econometric analysis of the determinants of women's mobility and decisionmaking authority. Data for the study come from a household data survey carried out in the Northern state of Uttar Pradesh and in the Southern state of Karnataka in 1995. We find that cross-cousin and uncle-niece marriage is more prevalent in Karnataka as expected. Contrary to Dyson and Moore, however, by 1995 a majority of communities in both North and South practiced village exogamy, and dowries in the two regions were of similar size. Reduced-form, multivariate regressions show that cultural factors affect women's autonomy in ways not earlier predicted. The impact of village exogamy is mixed rather than negative, while that of consanguinity is strongly negative rather than positive as Dyson and Moore surmised. These authors correctly identified the negative effect purdah has on female mobility. Consistent with economic theory, our data show that higher wages for women consistently improve their mobility and authority, while higher male wages decrease them. Improvements in infrastructure--particularly the presence of street lights and schools in the village--are associated with increased women's agency. We conclude, therefore, that economic factors, state action, and restrictions on mobility seem more powerful than kinship structures as explanations of differences in female autonomy between North and South India.

abstract = {Embezzlement of resources is hampering public service delivery throughout the developing world. Research on this issue is hindered by problems of measurement. To overcome these problems we use an economic experiment to investigate the determinants of corrupt behaviour. We focus on three aspects of behaviour: (i) embezzlement by public servants; (ii) monitoring effort by designated monitors; and, (iii) voting by community members when provided with an opportunity to select a monitor. The experiment allows us to study the effect of wages, effort observability, rules for monitor assignment, and professional norms. Our experimental subjects are Ethiopian nursing students. We find that service providers who earn more embezzle less, although the effect is small. Embezzlement is also lower when observability (associated with the risk of being caught and sanctioned) is high, and when service providers face an elected rather than randomly selected monitor. Monitors put more effort into monitoring when they face re-election and when the public servant receives a higher wage. Communities re-elect monitors who put more effort into exposing embezzlement. Framing—whereby players are referred to as “health workers” and “community members” rather than by abstract labels—affects neither mean embezzlement nor mean monitoring effort, but significantly increases the variance in both. This suggests that different types of experimental subject respond differently to the framing, possibly because they adhere to different norms.},

They show that when combatants fragment, the duration of war does not always increase and such wars often end in negotiated agreements, contrasting with the expectations of literatures on spoilers, moderates and extremists. Empirical cases, such as Iraq, Congo, Chechnya and the Sudan, illustrate the importance of fragmentation.

abstract = {We describe a new computer program that combines evolutionary algorithm methods with a derivative-based, quasi-Newton method to solve difficult unconstrained optimization problems. The program, called GENOUD (GENetic Optimization Using Derivatives), effectively solves problems that are nonlinear or perhaps even discontinuous in the parameters of the function to be optimized. When a statistical model's estimating function (for example, a log-likelihood) is nonlinear in the model's parameters, the function to be optimized will usually not be globally concave and may contain irregularities such as saddlepoints or discontinuous jumps. Optimization methods that rely on derivatives of the objective function may be unable to find any optimum at all. Or multiple local optima may exist, so that there is no guarantee that a derivative-based method will converge to the global optimum. We discuss the theoretical basis for expecting GENOUD to have a high probability of finding global optima. We conduct Monte Carlo experiments using scalar Normal mixture densities to illustrate this capability. We also use a system of four simultaneous nonlinear equations that has many parameters and multiple local optima to compare the performance of GENOUD to that of the Gauss-Newton algorithm in SAS's PROC MODEL.},

Insufficient deference to authority may incapacitate government, whereas too muchmay allowleaders to orchestrate mass violence. Although cross-national and cross-temporal variation in deference to authority and willingness to express dissent has long been studied in political science, rarely have scholars studied programs designed to change these aspects of political culture. This study, situated in post-genocide Rwanda, reports aqualitative and quantitative assessment of one such attempt, a radio program aimed at discouraging blind obedience and reliance on direction from authorities and promoting independent thought and collective action in problem solving. Over the course of one year, this radio program or a comparable program dealing with HIV was randomly presented to pairs of communities, including communities of genocide survivors, Twa people, and imprisoned g´ enocidaires. Changes in individual attitudes, perceived community norms, and deliberative behaviors were assessed using closed-ended interviews, focus group discussions, role-play exercises, and unobtrusive measures of collective decision making. Although the radio program had little effect on many kinds of beliefs and attitudes, it had a substantial impact on listeners’ willingness to express dissent and the ways they resolved communal problems.},

abstract = {Habit is a frequently mentioned but understudied cause of political action. This article provides the first direct test of the hypothesis that casting a ballot in one election increases ones propensity to go to the polls in the future. A field experiment involving 25,200 registered voters was conducted prior to the November general election of 1998. Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment conditions in which they were urged to vote through direct mail or face-to-face canvassing. Compared to a control group that received no contact, the treatment groups were significantly more likely to vote in 1998. The treatment groups were also significantly more likely to vote in local elections held in November of 1999. After deriving a statistical estimator to isolate the effect of habit, we find that, ceteris paribus, voting in one election substantially increases the likelihood of voting in the future. Indeed, the influence of past voting exceeds the effects of age and education reported in previous studies.},

This article investigates one specific worry--that participatory decision-making processes may be vulnerable to manipulation by elites. The authors report on a field experiment, drawing on a unique nationwide experiment in democratic deliberation in S\~{a}o Tom\'{e} and Pr\'{\i}ncipe in which the discussion leaders were randomly assigned across meetings. The randomization procedure provides a rare opportunity to identify the impact of leaders on the outcomes of group deliberations. They find that leader effects were extremely large, in many cases accounting for over one-third of all variation in the outcomes of the national discussions. These results have important implications for the design of such deliberative practices. While the total effect of leadership cannot be assessed, it may still be possible to observe when leader influence occurs and to correct for leader effects in comparisons of outcomes across deliberations.

abstract = {This paper explores how the quality of information available to voters ináuences the choices they make in the polling booth and in turn a§ects the strategies of political parties competing for their support. To do so, the paper builds a model of redistributive politics under asymmetric information and then tests the resulting propositions with data from recent elections in Sierra Leone. Using the Lindbeck and Weibull (1987) model as a foundation, I incorporate a new determinant of voting choiceó candidate qualityó which is only imperfectly observed by voters. I show that voters with better information about candidates are more likely to cross ethnic party lines to support a high quality candidate. Furthermore, since information encourages voters to consider characteristics like candidate charisma that are di¢ cult for parties to observe, it makes party forecasting of expected vote shares more uncertain. Such electoral uncertainty in turn induces parties to spread their resources more evenly across jurisdictions. Two institutional attributes of the empirical settingó ethnicity-based politics and decentralizationó enable direct tests of these informational propositions as well as a novel identiÖcation strategy for the classic swing voter hypothesis. My results suggest that information could break the low accountability equilibrium in which citizens cast their votes blindly along partisan lines, creating little incentive for political parties to invest in candidate quality or provide resources to areas outside the most tightly contested jurisdictions.},

It introduces further evidence and theoretical elaboration supporting Paluck's conclusion that exposure to a reconciliation-themed radio soap opera changed perceptions of social norms and behaviors, not beliefs. Experimental and longitudinal survey evidence reinforces the finding that the radio program affected socially shared perceptions of typical or prescribed behavior-that is, social norms. Specifically, measurements of perceptions of social norms called into question by Staub and Pearlman are shown to correlate with perceptions of public opinion and public, not private, behaviors. Although measurement issues and the mechanisms of the radio program's influence merit further testing, theory and evidence point to social interactions and emotional engagement, not individual education, as the likely mechanisms of change. The present exchange makes salient what is at stake in this debate: a model of change based on learning and personal beliefs versus a model based on group influence and social norms. These theoretical models recommend very different strategies for prejudice and conflict reduction. Future field experiments should attempt to adjudicate between these models by testing relevant policies in real-world settings.},

Empirical results prove consistent with the predictions of the model.

This paper offers a novel theoretical account of such patterns of deviation by demonstrating that EU violations can emerge from evolutionary selection when individual "status" affects inclusive fitness. In humans, battles for resources and social standing involve high-stakes decision making, and assortative mating ensures that status matters for fitness outcomes.

Additionally, greater restrictions have been placed by Persian Gulf states on migrant labourers, resulting in decreased opportunities abroad. I argue that it is the culture of migration among Hyderabadi Muslim professionals and labourers that promotes migration to the US and Saudi Arabia, even though opportunities at home are greater for some, and opportunities abroad are more restricted for others.

A more novel proposal is to use field experimentation as the organizing methodological framework for archival, ethnographic, or interpretive work, and to use ethnographic methods as the primary source of measurement in “experimental ethnography.” Sustained research and theoretical specificity can address some of the seemingly incompatible features of qualitative and field experimental methods. For example, small sample sizes are acceptable as part of a research program, and some theories of historical patterns or rare events could be disaggregated into smaller cause and effect linkages to test with field experiments in theoretically relevant contexts.},

Regulation of the public sector involves regulators operating at arms-length from those they regulate using systems of standard setting, monitoring and enforcement. In the past three decades in the UK, regulation has become increasingly important both in terms of absolute resources devoted to the activity and relative to other forms of control (particularly self-control by public sector professionals and control within large integrated bureaucratic structures). These trends have, in part, been fuelled by executive politicians' attempts to control public services and demands from citizens and users for better quality and efficiency. In the past decade, more explicit and extensive review of regulation of the public sector has been undertaken. Whilst not as developed as private sector Regulatory Impact Analyses these reviews have promoted the use of techniques including regulatory enforcement pyramids and risk based regulatory approaches. ?? 2005 Elsevier SAS.

In this paper I utilize price data from political risk insurance agencies to directly test how domestic political institutions affect the premiums multinationals pay for coverage against government expropriations and contract disputes.

abstract = {The interpretation of the resource-conflict link that has become most publicized—the rebel greed hypothesis—depends on just one of many plausible mechanisms that could underlie a relationship between resource dependence and violence. The author catalogues a large range of rival possible mechanisms, highlights a set of techniques that may be used to identify these mechanisms, and begins to employ these techniques to distinguish between rival accounts of the resource-conflict linkages. The author uses finer natural resource data than has been used in the past, gathering and presenting new data on oil and diamonds production and on oil stocks. The author finds evidence that (1) conflict onset is more responsive to the impacts of past natural resource production than to the potential for future production, supporting a weak states mechanism rather than a rebel greed mechanism; (2) the impact of natural resources on conflict cannot easily be attributed entirely to the weak states mechanism, and in particular, the impact of natural resources is independent of state strength; (3) the link between primary commodities and conflict is driven in part by agricultural dependence rather than by natural resources more narrowly defined, a finding consistent with a “sparse networks” mechanism; (4) natural resources are associated with shorter wars, and natural resource wars are more likely to end with military victory for one side than other wars. This is consistent with evidence that external actors have incentives to work to bring wars to a close when natural resource supplies are threatened. The author finds no evidence that resources are associated with particular difficulties in negotiating ends to conflicts, contrary to arguments that loot-seeking rebels aim to prolong wars. },

abstract = {Recently there has been a surge in international empirical evidence that national policymakers allocate resources across regions based on political considerations, in addition to any normative considerations of equity and efficiency. In order to mitigate these political compulsions, several federations around the world have attempted to create independent constitutional bodies that are responsible for determining federal transfers to subnational jurisdictions. Khemani tests whether constitutional rules indeed make a difference in curbing political influence by contrasting the impact of political variables on two types of intergovernmental transfers to states in the Indian federation over a period of time, 1972-95. The pattern of evidence shows that transfers, whose regional distribution is determined by political agents, usually provide greater resources to state governments that are politically affiliated with the national ruling party and are important in maximizing the party's representation in the national legislature. But the political effect on statutory transfers, determined by an independent agency with constitutional authority, is strikingly contrary, with greater resources going to unaffiliated state governments. The author argues that this contrasting evidence indicates that constitutional rules indeed restrict the extent to which partisan politics can affect resources available to subnational governments.},

Given the complexity of federalism, this may be an unrealistic assumption for many citizens.

Our simulations assess efficiency across a variety of scenarios involving varying sample sizes and numbers of clusters. Our results confirm that conventional OLS SEs are severely biased downward and that, for all estimators, gains in efficiency come mainly from increasing the number of clusters, not increasing the number of individuals within clusters. We find relatively minor differences across alternative estimation approaches, but GLS seems to enjoy a slight edge in terms of the efficiency of its point estimates and the accuracy of its SEs.

In this paper, I explore how political institutions, specifically the level of democracy, affect firm-level taxation across the world. I argue that electoral competition leads democratic governments to higher levels of taxation on firms. Using a data set on firm tax payments on the foreign affiliates of US multinational corporations from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, I show that there are large variations within countries on the tax burdens faced by firms that are not explained by national tax rates. I find evidence that the mobility of the specific investment project, the types of spillovers these investments provide to a community, and attributes of the parent firm are all important determinants of taxation. While firm-level factors clearly affect corporate taxation, I argue that democratic institutions limit the offering of tax incentives and generate electoral benefits to policing tax avoidance by multinational corporations. After controlling for parent firm and foreign affiliate–level factors, I find that democratic countries generate as much as 26\% more tax revenues from multinational corporations relative to authoritarian countries.},

We show that credit layering is preferred only when tenants are sufficiently poor. In this case, the trader lends to tenant farmers via a contract with their landlord. Otherwise, only the trader lends. As a consequence, a pattern of borrowing emerges in which relatively wealthy tenants borrow from merchants while poor tenants borrow mainly from their landlords.

Using a new dataset on fighting groups in Sierra Leone, this article analyzes the determinants of the tactics, strategies, and behaviors that warring factions employ in their relationships with noncombatants. We first describe a simple logic of extraction which we use to generate hypotheses about variation in levels of abuse across fighting units. We then show that the most important determinants of civilian abuse are internal to the structure of the faction. High levels of abuse are exhibited by warring factions that are unable to police the behavior of their members because they are more ethnically fragmented, rely on material incentives to recruit participants, and lack mechanisms for punishing indiscipline.

We address this debate by entertaining the possibility that contextual information coupled with a source cue may enhance the effectiveness of group endorsements as a heuristic.

abstract = {Community organizations in developing countries often suffer from self-serving local elites. This study examines whether the responsiveness of local leaders to community members can be strengthened through more inclusive and participatory rules. To ad- dress identification problems, I take advantage of a project implementation error that resulted in exogenous variation in the rules for selecting leaders of farmer associations in Uganda. I find that compared to appointed leaders, directly elected leaders are sig- nificantly more responsive to group members, leading to higher levels of cooperation. Analyzing possible mechanisms, I find that community organizations using appoint- ments are less likely to develop monitoring institutions and auditing practices that are vital for constraining the behavior of local elites. Unique social network data provides evidence that close friendship ties between appointed and appointees substitute for formal monitoring institutions, leading to loss of confidence by community members and, subsequently, to a decline in public goods contributions.},

Yet eliciting truthful answers in surveys is challenging, especially when studying sensitive issues such as racial prejudice, corruption, and support for militant groups. List experiments have attracted much attention recently as a potential solution to this measurement problem. Many researchers, however, have used a simple difference-in-means estimator, which prevents the efficient examination of multivariate relationships between respondents’ characteristics and their responses to sensitive items. Moreover, no systematic means exists to investigate the role of underlying assumptions. We fill these gaps by developing a set of new statistical methods for list experiments. We identify the commonly invoked assumptions, propose new multivariate regression estimators, and develop methods to detect and adjust for potential violations of key assumptions. For empirical illustration, we analyze list experiments concerning racial prejudice. Open-source software is made available to implement the proposed methodology.},

The author argues that in three cases which illustrate the equilibrium paths of the game-theoretic model developed here-postindependence Bostwana, Mobutu's Zaire, and Suharto's Indonesia-three variables influenced elites' incentives for diversification and thereby shaped outcomes along the dimensions of political stability and economic performance: the world market structure for the resource, the degree of societal opposition to elites, and the prior development of the nonresource private sector. These countries' varied paths from resource wealth to political and economic outcomes suggest the need for conditional theories of the resource curse.},

A Guatemalan microfinance lender gradually started using a credit bureau across its branches without letting borrowers know about it. One year later, we ran a large randomized credit information course that described the existence and workings of the bureau to the clients of this lender. This pairing of natural and randomized experiments allows us to separately identify how new information enters on the supply and the demand sides of the market. Our results indicate that the credit bureau generated large efficiency gains for the lender, and that these gains were augmented when borrowers understood the rules of the game. The credit bureau rewarded good borrowers but penalized weaker ones, increasing economic differentiation. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

Insufficient deference to authority may incapacitate government, whereas too muchmay allowleaders to orchestrate mass violence. Although cross-national and cross-temporal variation in deference to authority and willingness to express dissent has long been studied in political science, rarely have scholars studied programs designed to change these aspects of political culture. This study, situated in post-genocide Rwanda, reports aqualitative and quantitative assessment of one such attempt, a radio program aimed at discouraging blind obedience and reliance on direction from authorities and promoting independent thought and collective action in problem solving. Over the course of one year, this radio program or a comparable program dealing with HIV was randomly presented to pairs of communities, including communities of genocide survivors, Twa people, and imprisoned g´ enocidaires. Changes in individual attitudes, perceived community norms, and deliberative behaviors were assessed using closed-ended interviews, focus group discussions, role-play exercises, and unobtrusive measures of collective decision making. Although the radio program had little effect on many kinds of beliefs and attitudes, it had a substantial impact on listeners’ willingness to express dissent and the ways they resolved communal problems.},

Despite the length of time that these policy experiments have been in force, there is little agreement about their effectiveness. We argue that part of this ambivalence stems from three limitations of extant studies, suggesting that future studies of decentralized natural resource governance should consider a combination of 1) variation in the local institutional context, 2) the fit between the reform and other public policies, and 3) more adequate outcome measures for decentralized resource governance. After developing such an approach, we posit that varying forest conditions depend on the moderating effects that local institutions have on the socioe- conomic and biophysical drivers of environmental change. Analyzing data from inter- views and remotely sensed images from 30 municipalities in the Bolivian lowlands, we find that the local institutional performance affects unauthorized deforestation directly and indirectly, but detect no effects on either permitted or total deforestation.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the nature of unemployment among young men in urban Ethiopia and finds that it is concentrated among relatively well-educated first-time job seekers who aspire to a public sector job and spend on average close to four years in unemployment. This is consistent with a segmented labor market model where youngsters queue in unemployment for a good job, as confirmed by an empirical test of the theoretical prediction. We observe a negative (causal) relationship between household welfare and both the incidence and duration of unemployment, indicating that unemployment is concentrated among the relatively worse off urban households, which from a national perspective represent the middle classes, and find suggestive evidence that part of this effect is due to malnutrition during childhood. Job search through social networks is only effective after one has become unemployed, suggesting that networks provide insurance only after exposure to the risk. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

However, there is also reason to believe that such programs can affect other outcomes, such as the sexual behavior of their young beneficiaries. Zomba Cash Transfer Program is a randomized ongoing CCT intervention targeting young women in Malawi that provides incentives (in the form of school fees and cash transfers) to current schoolgirls and recent dropouts to stay in or return to school. An average offer of US\$10/ month conditional on satisfactory school attendance – plus direct payment of secondary school fees – led to significant declines in early marriage, teenage pregnancy, and self-reported sexual activity among program beneficiaries after just one year of program implementation. For program beneficiaries who were out of school at baseline, the probability of getting married and becoming pregnant declined by more than 40 and 30\%, respectively. In addition, the incidence of the onset of sexual activity was 38\% lower among all program beneficiaries than the control group. Overall, these results suggest that CCT programs not only serve as useful tools for improving school attendance but may also reduce sexual activity, teen pregnancy, and early marriage.},

While others have raised concerns about the measurement of ethnic variables in these works, we seek to situate such discussions within a more thoroughgoing conceptual analysis. Specifically, we argue that four conceptual approaches—demographic, cognitive, behavioral, and institutional—have been used to develop theories in which the mechanism that relates causes to outcomes is ethnic political competition . Within this literature, we believe that institutional approaches have been relatively under-appreciated, and we attempt to address that imbalance. We begin by critically reviewing the three main ways in which ethnic variables have been specified and operationalized, delineating the assumptions and trade-offs underlying their use. Next, we describe an institutional approach to the study of ethnic politics, which focuses on the rules and procedures for differentiating ethnic categories. We propose some new indices based on this latter approach that might be developed and used in future research. Subsequently, we analyze the relationship between each of these approaches and patterns of ethnic political competition in a set of six country cases, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, as well as theoretical links between them.},

(760-761) Institutions both shape and reflect the strategic interaction among agents.

(772) o The national interests cannot be assumed o Governments (i.e., domestic decision-makers) become the main actors in the international system A major problem for theory building has been to develop a systematic way to explore which and how domestic factors affect international politics. (773) o Both domestic and international politics are somewhere in between anarchy and hierarchythey are polyarchic International politics and foreign policy are part of the domestic struggle for power over collective outcomes and the search for internal compromise. o Two factors determine the degree of polyarchy Policy preferences of domestic actors Institutions for power sharing among the actors Allison and Halperin (1972, 57): Decisions of a government seldom reflect a single, coherent, consistent set of calculations about national security interests. Decisions typically reflect considerable compromise. Relaxing the Assumption of the State as the Primary Actor in International Politics Mearsheimer (1994, 7): Realists maintain that international institutions are basically a reflection of the distribution of power in the world. They are based on the self-interested calculations of great powers, and they have no independent effect on state behavior. Institutionalism allows us to speak with a common language when discussing domestic and international institutions, giving us more leverage to explain international relations o Institutions, whether domestic or not, act to aggregate diverse preferences into a collective outcome. (780) Comparative analysis of institutions seems especially important because it avoids the post hoc quality of some institutional research. If one can show that different institutions result in different outcomes and the conditions under which those different institutions might be optimal, then both a positive and prescriptive perspective on institutions can be achieved.

abstract = {Responding to conflict, in Indonesia and elsewhere, requires an understanding of its distribution, forms, and impacts. In this article, we outline an attempt to use local newspaper monitoring to measure the levels and impacts of violent conflict during the period 2001-2003 in two Indonesian provinces (East Java and NTT). We also assess variation in incidence, impact, and form across and within areas. The study data suggest first that previous research has vastly underestimated the impacts of violent conflict in Indonesia. Comparing our data with those of the previous attempt to use newspapers to map conflict in Indonesia (by the UN Support Facility for Indonesian Recovery [UNSFIR]), we find three times as many deaths from collective violence. These differences are a function of the level of news sources used, with provincial papers picking up only a small proportion of deaths in our research areas. Further, we argue that the impacts of certain types of violence between individuals should be included, leading to even higher figures. Second, our data call into question the dictum that violence in Indonesia is concentrated in a small number of regions. While there is variation between districts, we record large impacts from collective violence in areas not previously considered conflict-prone. Third, substantial variations in conflict form are found across regions, and these result in different kinds of impacts. This underlines the importance of consideration of the role of local factors in driving conflicts and suggests that approaches must be tailored to local conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that using local newspapers to measure and analyze conflicts presents a useful tool for understanding conflict in Indonesia. The use of subprovincial news sources captures more accurate estimates of conflict incidence than other methods, such as provincial newspaper mapping or surveying. It can also provide a basis for a deeper understanding of variations in patterns of conflict across areas and provide insights into how we might respond.

abstract = {Members of the same household share similar voting behaviors on average, but howmuch of this correlation can be attributed to the behavior of theother person in the household? Disentangling and isolating the unique effects of peer behavior, selection processes, and congruent interests is a challenge for all studies of interpersonal influence. This study proposes and utilizes a carefully designed placebo-controlled experimental protocol to overcome this identification problem.During a face-to-face canvassing experiment targeting households with two registered voters, residents who answered the door were exposed to either a Get Out the Vote message (treatment) or a recycling pitch (placebo). The turnout of the person in the household not answering the door allows for contagion to be measured. Both experiments find that 60\% of the propensity to vote is passed onto the other member of the household. This finding suggests a mechanism by which civic participation norms are adopted and couples grow more similar over time.},

abstract = {The item count technique is a survey methodology that is designed to elicit respondents? truthful answers to sensitive questions such as racial prejudice and drug use. The method is also known as the list experiment or the unmatched count technique and is an alternative to the commonly used randomized response method. In this article, I propose new nonlinear least squares and maximum likelihood estimators for efficient multivariate regression analysis with the item count technique. The two-step estimation procedure and the Expectation Maximization algorithm are developed to facilitate the computation. Enabling multivariate regression analysis is essential because researchers are typically interested in knowing how the probability of answering the sensitive question affirmatively varies as a function of respondents? characteristics. As an empirical illustration, the proposed methodology is applied to the 1991 National Race and Politics survey where the investigators used the item count technique to measure the degree of racial hatred in the United States. Small-scale simulation studies suggest that the maximum likelihood estimator can be substantially more efficient than alternative estimators. Statistical efficiency is an important concern for the item count technique because indirect questioning means loss of information. The open-source software is made available to implement the proposed methodology.},

I dwell on two issues: questions of method and the urgency of refocusing our efforts on leaders and domestic affairs as the centerpiece for understanding the world of international relations. I argue that scientific progress is best made by combining three methodological approaches in our research: formal, mathematical logic to ensure internal consistency in arguments about complex and contingent relations among variables; case studies and archival research to evaluate verisimilitude between theory and action; and statistical analysis to establish the generality of the hypothesized relations among variables. Often such methodologically diverse and progressive research will best be accomplished by encouraging collaboration rather than by perpetuating the current norm of penalizing coauthorship especially among junior scholars. I offer concrete examples of advances in knowledge achieved through the employment of mathematical reasoning and statistical analysis as many have cast doubts about the substantive contributions of these particular approaches. My perspective is, of course, personal and may not be shared by many others. I set out my thoughts, therefore, with the hope that they will stimulate constructive debate and dialogue and that they will serve to integrate diverse approaches to international affairs.},

abstract = {This paper describes and analyzes the results of a unique field experiment especially designed to test the effects of the level of commitment and information available to individuals when sharing risk. We find that limiting exogenously provided commitmentis associated with less risk sharing, whereas limiting information on defections can be associated with more risk sharing. These results can be understood by distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic incentives, and by recognizing that social sanctions are costly to inflict or that individuals suffer from time-inconsistent preferences. Comparing the groups formed within our experiment with the real life risk-sharing networks in a few villages allows us to test the external validity of our experiment and suggests that the results are salient to our understanding of risk-sharing arrangements observed in developing countries.

@article{Milner1995,
abstract = {Global economic interdependence has created incentives for greater international economic co‐operation. In many instances, these incentives have led states to accept important and controversial co‐operative agreements, despite their costs. A crucial form of contemporary international economic policy co‐operation is the development of regional patterns of economic integration, exemplified by the NAFTA accord and the Maastricht Treaty on European Monetary Union (EMU). Why did countries choose to co‐operate in NAFTA and the EMU, especially given the costs? This question is addressed in three parts. First, why did political leaders initiate these negotiations? Given the costs of such far‐reaching accords, why were leaders interested in pursuing them? The second issue is why were the countries able to reach agreement? A number of factors, such as the end of the Cold War and the economic difficulties experienced by the advanced industrial countries after 1987, could have undermined such co‐operation. Finally, what made domestic ratification possible? Political leaders who negotiated NAFTA and EMU had to obtain domestic approval from their legislatures or electorates. Ratification proved to be a problem in both agreements. The answers to these questions lie in the intersection of domestic and international politics. International economic co‐operation results from the calculations of political leaders, whose first priority is getting re‐elected, and is constrained by the need for domestic ratification of any agreement negotiated. These domestic factors are, however, linked to international ones. The political calculations of leaders about initiation and ratification depend on the extent of international economic ties that a country possesses. Heightened economic openness meant that leaders had to seek joint solutions to their economic problems in order to survive politically. Co‐operation is inextricably linked to the electoral calculus of political leaders.},

abstract = {Dissatisfied with centralized approaches to delivering local public services, a large number of countries are decentralizing responsibility for these services to lower-level, locally elected governments. The results have been mixed. This chapter provides a framework for evaluating the benefits and costs, in terms of service delivery, of different approaches to decentralization, based on relationships of accountability between different actors in the delivery chain. Moving from a model of central provision to that of decentralization to local governments introduces a new relationship of accountability— between national and local policymakers—while altering existing relationships, such as that between citizens and elected politicians. Only by examining how these relationships change can we understand why decentralization can, and sometimes cannot, lead to better service delivery. In particular, the various instruments of decentralization—fiscal, administrative, regulatory, market, and financial—can affect the incentives facing service providers, even though they relate only to local policymakers. Likewise, and perhaps more significantly, the incentives facing local and national politicians can have a profound effect on the provision of local services. Finally, the process of implementing decentralization can be as important as the design of the system in influencing service delivery outcomes.},

abstract = {Social networks are increasingly being recognized as having an important influence on labour market outcomes, since they facilitate the exchange of job related information. Access to information about job opportunities as well as perceptions about the buoyancy of the labour market depend critically on the social structures and the social networks to which labour market participants belong. In this paper, we examine the impact of information externalities generated through network membership on labour market status. Using Census data from South Africa, a country characterized by high levels of unemployment and worker discouragement, we adopt an econometric approach that aims to minimise the problems of omitted variable bias that have plagued many previous studies of the impact of social networks. Our results suggest that social networks may enhance employment probabilities by an additional 3-12\%, and that failure to adequately control for omitted variables would lead to substantial over-estimates of the network co-efficient. In contrast, the impact of social networks on reducing worker discouragement is much smaller, at between 1 and 2\%. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

How do exist- ing theories about trade policy explain this puzzle? Three sets of explana- tions are prominent. First, many focus on changes in trade policy preferences among domestic actors, either societal groups or political leaders. Second, scholars examine changes in political institutions to account for such policy change. Third, they seek explanations in changes in the international politi- cal system. Large-scale changes in political institutions, especially in the direction of democracy, may be necessary for the kind of massive trade liber- alization that has occurred. But changes in preferences cannot be overlooked in explaining the rush to free trade. Moreover, the influence of international institutions has been important. Finally, the reciprocal impact of trade on do- mestic politics and the international political system is important. If the rush to free trade is sustained, will its impact be benign or malign?},

abstract = {Social sanctioning is widely considered a successful strategy to promote cooperation among humans. In situations in which individual and collective interests are at odds, incentives to free-ride induce individuals to refrain from contributing to public goods provision. Experimental evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed with sanctioning powers, conditional cooperators can discipline defectors, thus leading to greater levels of cooperation. However, extant evidence is based on peer punishment institutions, whereas in complex societies, systems of control are often centralized: for instance, we do not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the police do. Here we show the effect of centralized sanctioning and legitimate authority on cooperation. We designed an adaptation of the public goods game in which sanctioning power is given to a single monitor, and we experimentally manipulated the process by which the monitor is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study, we conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1,543 Ugandan farmers from 50 producer cooperatives. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal effect of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more responsive to the authority of an elected monitor than a randomly chosen monitor. Our essay contributes to the literature on the evolution of cooperation by introducing the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies, cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of selection and reciprocity among peers, but also by the legitimacy that certain actors derive from their position in the social hierarchy.},

We distinguish between two aspects of this type of utility, intrinsic satisfaction from behaving in accordance with a norm and extrinsic incentives to comply, and test the effects of priming intrinsic motives and applying varying degrees of extrinsic pressure. A large-scale field experiment involving several hundred thousand registered voters used a series of mailings to gauge these effects. Substantially higher turnout was observed among those who received mailings promising to publicize their turnout to their household or their neighbors. These findings demonstrate the profound importance of social pressure as an inducement to political participation.},

The escape clause is endogenous in a model of repeated trade-barrier setting in the presence of symmetric, two-sided, political uncertainty. They permit, along the equilibrium path, countries to temporarily deviate from their obligations in periods of excessive, unexpected political pressure at some prenegotiated cost. The architects of international agreements optimally choose a cost so that escape clauses are neither too cheap to use (encouraging frequent recourse, effectively reducing the benefits of cooperation) nor too expensive (making their use rare and increasing the chance of systemic breakdown). The international institution's crucial role is to provide information, verifying that the self-enforcing penalty has been paid (voluntarily), rather than to coerce payment. Escape clauses also make agreements easier to reach initially. Their flexibility reassures states that the division of the long-term gains from the agreement is not immutable.},

Both proponents and opponents of electoral reforms agree that these reforms should increase the demographic representativeness of the electorate by reducing the direct costs of voting, thereby increasing turnout among less-privileged groups who, presumably, aremost sensitive to the costs of coming to the polls. In fact, these reforms have been greatly contested because both major political parties believe that increasing turnout among less-privileged groups will benefit Democratic politicians. I review evidence from numerous studies of electoral reform to demonstrate that reforms designed to make it easier for registered voters to cast their ballots actually increase, rather than reduce, socioeconomic biases in the composition of the voting public. I conclude with a recommendation that we shift the focus of electoral reform from an emphasis on institutional changes to a concentration on political engagement.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:This paper explores the implementation and sustenance of universal health coverage (UHC) in Costa Rica, discussing the development of a social security scheme that covered 5\% of the population in 1940, to one that finances and provides comprehensive healthcare to the whole population today. The scheme is financed by mandatory, tri-partite social insurance contributions complemented by tax funding to cover the poor.METHODS:The analysis takes a historical perspective and explores the policy process including the key actors and their relative influence in decision-making. Data were collected using qualitative research instruments, including a review of literature, institutional and other documents, and in-depth interviews with key informants.RESULTS:Key lessons to be learned are: i) population health was high on the political agenda in Costa Rica, in particular before the 1980s when UHC was enacted and the transfer of hospitals to the social security institution took place. Opposition to UHC could therefore be contained through negotiation and implemented incrementally despite the absence of real consensus among the policy elite; ii) since the 1960s, the social security institution has been responsible for UHC in Costa Rica. This institution enjoys financial and managerial autonomy relative to the general government, which has also facilitated the UHC policy implementation process; iii) UHC was simultaneously constructed on three pillars that reciprocally strengthened each other: increasing population coverage, increasing availability of financial resources based on solidarity financing mechanisms, and increasing service coverage, ultimately offering comprehensive health services and the same benefits to every resident in the country; iv) particularly before the 1980s, the fruits of economic growth were structurally invested in health and other universal social policies, in particular education and sanitation. The social security institution became a flagship of Costa Rica's national development strategy which reinforced its political importance and contributed to its longer-term sustainability and that of UHC.CONCLUSIONS:UHC has been achieved in Costa Rica because it was supported at the highest political level within a favourable socio-economic and political context. Once achieved, UHC became an entitlement for the population and now enjoys broad public support.},

abstract = {Community-based and -driven development projects have become an important form of development assistance, with the World Bank's portfolio alone approximating \$7 billion. A review of their conceptual foundations and evidence on their effectiveness shows that projects that rely on community participation have not been particularly effective at targeting the poor. There is some evidence that such projects create effective community infrastructure, but not a single study establishes a causal relationship between any outcome and participatory elements of a community-based development project. Most such projects are dominated by elites, and both targeting and project quality tend to be markedly worse in more unequal communities. A distinction between potentially “benevolent” forms of elite domination and more pernicious types of capture is likely to be important for understanding project dynamics and outcomes. Several qualitative studies indicate that the sustainability of community-based initiatives depends crucially on an enabling institutional environment, which requires government commitment, and on accountability of leaders to their community to avoid “supply-driven demand-driven” development. External agents strongly influence project success, but facilitators are often poorly trained, particularly in rapidly scaled-up programs. The naive application of complex contextual concepts like participation, social capital, and empowerment is endemic among project implementers and contributes to poor design and implementation. The evidence suggests that community-based and -driven development projects are best undertaken in a context-specific manner, with a long time horizon and with careful and well-designed monitoring and evaluation systems.},

Parties opposing peace successfully subverted negotiated agreements in contexts as diverse as Rwanda, Northern Ireland, and Bosnia. Despite growing attention to civil wars in the empirical literature, little formal-theoretic work addresses the dynamics of civil wars. Empirical work demonstrates that the resolution of civil wars is both complex and uncertain: civil war combatants are heterogeneous in their traits, incompletely informed, and thus, boundedly rational, capable of learning from history and adapting their behavior—all hallmarks of a complex adaptive system. I employ an agent-based model, therefore, to capture these characteristics and address the conditions affecting the dynamics and evolution of civil wars. In particular, I focus on the evolutionary context of civil wars including learning and adaption and find that civil wars with adaptive combatants exhibit vastly different behavior than those without adaptive agents.},

They do so to their detriment because heeding the basic lessons of statistical inference can prevent serious inferential errors. Of particular importance is the use of conditional probabilities to compare relevant counterfactuals. A prominent example of work using Mill\&apos;s methods is Theda Skocpol\&apos;s States and Social Revolutions. Barbara Geddes\&apos;s widely assigned critique of Skocpol\&apos;s claim of a causal relationship between foreign threat and social revolution is valid if this relationship is considered to be deterministic. If, however, we interpret Skocpol\&apos;s hypothesized causal relationship to be probabilistic, Geddes\&apos;s data support Skocpol\&apos;s hypothesis. But Skocpol, unlike Geddes, failed to provide the data necessary to compare conditional probabilities. Also problematic for Skocpol is the fact that when one makes causal inferences, conditional probabilities are of interest only insofar as they provide information about relevant counterfactuals.Jasjeet S.

In particular, we compare at-large elections with district elections. We propose a theoretical model where the differ- ence in electoral systems occurs because elected legislators have to bargain over policy, and in district elections, citizens have a strategic motive to elect candidates with more polarized policy positions at the expense of competence. Empirical results prove consistent with the predictions of the model. Specifically, we find that competent candidates are more likely to be elected in at-large elections and that this difference is larger in more heterogenous villages.},

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2009-18259-012). To improve our understanding of corruption in service delivery, we use a newly designed game that allows us to investigate the effects of the institutional environment on the behavior of service providers and their monitors. We focus on the effect of four different factors: whether monitors are accountable to the service recipients, the degree of observability of service providers' effort, the providers' wages and the providers' professional norms. In accordance with theory, we find that service providers perform better when monitors are elected by service recipients and when their effort is more easily observed. However, there is only weak evidence that service providers perform better when paid more. Monitors are more vigilant when elected and when service providers are paid more. Playing the game with Ethiopian nursing students, we also find that those with greater exposure to the Ethiopian public health sector perform less well, either as provider or as monitor, when the experiment is framed as a public health provision scenario, suggesting that experience and norms affect behavior.

In response to doubts about the generalizability of our earlier findings to panel studies of longer duration or from other eras, we show that nine multi-wave panel studies yield similar results. Next, we take up the question of whether our model can account for observed patterns of partisan conversion. The rate of party-switching forces some modifications in the statistical assumptions used to model party identification over time, but a revised model which can account for inter-party change reproduces earlier findings of partisan stability. Third, we grapple with the question of how our findings square with fluctuations in what has been termed “macropartisanship”. We suggest that aggregate shifts in party identification need not be incompatible with strong over-time correlations at the individual level. Finally, we develop a simulation of micropartisanship to illustrate that over long stretches of time very gradual changes in partisanship can accumulate to produce appreciable levels of micropartisan change.},

abstract = {Interpersonal communication presents a methodological challenge and a research opportunity for researchers involved in field experiments. The challenge is that communication among subjects blurs the line between treatment and control conditions. When treatment effects are transmitted from subject to subject, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) is violated, and comparison of treatment and control outcomes may provide a biased assessment of the treatment’s causal influence. Social scientists are increasingly interested in the substantive phenomena that lead to SUTVA violations, such as communication in advance of an election. Experimental designs that gauge SUTVA violations provide useful insights into the extent and influence of interpersonal communication. This article illustrates the value of one such design, a multilevel experiment in which treatments are randomly assigned to individuals and varying proportions of their neighbors. After describing the theoretical and statistical underpinnings of this design, we apply it to a large-scale voter-mobilization experiment conducted in Chicago during a special election in 2009 using social-pressure mailings that highlight individual electoral participation. We find some evidence of within-household spillovers but no evidence of spillovers across households. We conclude by discussing how multilevel designs might be employed in other substantive domains, such as the study of deterrence and policy diffusion.},

Although the randomized experiment is widely considered the gold standard for determining whether a given exposure increases the likelihood of some specified outcome, experiments are not always feasible and in some cases can result in biased estimates of causal effects. Alternatively, standard observational approaches are limited by the possibility of confounding, reverse causation, and the nonrandom distribution of exposure (i.e., selection). We describe the counterfactual model of causation and apply it to the challenges of causal inference in observational research, with a particular focus on aging. We argue that the study of twin pairs discordant on exposure, and in particular discordant monozygotic twins, provides a useful analog to the idealized counterfactual design. A review of discordant-twin studies in aging reveals that they are consistent with, but do not unambiguously establish, a causal effect of lifestyle factors on important late-life outcomes. Nonetheless, the existing studies are few in number and have clear limitations that have not always been considered in interpreting their results. It is concluded that twin researchers could make greater use of the discordant-twin design as one approach to strengthen causal inferences in observational research.},

A higher level of monitoring increases leader effort, raising the value of the public good.

The result is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the level of monitoring and the value of the public good.

Using this design, we can observe whether the association between partisanship and economic assessments holds when some leading mechanisms thought to bring it about are excluded.

In this article, we explore how single-party regimes manage this trade-off and the particular types of information available to them. Using candidate-level data from Vietnam, we demonstrate that single-party regimes, in particular, forsake information on overall regime support and strength of opposition in favor of information on the popularity of local notables and the compliance of local officials with central mandates. In addition, we show that ex ante electioneering is less risky than ex post fraud at achieving these goals.},

We bring these data to bear on concerns raised by Prior (2013a) about the construct and convergent validity of the new ANES measures. Our results add nuance to previous findings showing respon- dents’ propensity to overreport exposure to news, and also demonstrate that on average, self-reported measures reflect relative levels of exposure quite well. Additionally, we show that the more unique news programs a person watches, the more total time he or she is exposed to political news. Very few people watch only one program but watch it repeatedly. The data also reveal an increase in the number of programs watched leading up to election day, and a concomitant increase in the amount of time per capita spent with political news as elections approach. We conclude, however, that the program– count measure is not without its weaknesses. Shortening the list of programs affects construct validity by introducing noise into the low end of the scale. Expanding the list of programs in the survey to include local news and special reports will improve fidelity at the low end of this new measure.},

abstract = {Recent scholarship argues that one solution to ensure longevity and economic growth in an authoritarian regime is to co-opt potential opposition by offering them limited policy influence in a national legislature. Although cooptation theory generates a number of predictions for delegate behavior within an authoritarian parliament, the opacity of such regimes has made empirical confirmation difficult. We resolve this problem by exploiting the transcripts of query sessions in the Vietnamese National Assembly, where delegates question the prime minister and Cabinet members on important issues of the day. Using a content analysis of queries, we offer the first empirical test of delegate behavior in nondemocratic parliaments. We find that some delegates exhibit behavior consistent with cooptation theory by actively participating in sessions, demonstrating criticism of authorities, and responding to the needs of local constituents. Such responsiveness, however, is parameterized by regime rules for nominating, electing, and assigning parliamentary responsibilities to individual delegates.

I find that localities with no formal punishments for littering experienced sustained reductions in littering behavior and increases in the frequency of public clean-ups.

abstract = {Vote buying is a frequent practice during election time in many parts of the world. But no research has been done to quantify its effects on voters’ electoral behavior. To address this challenge, we have designed and conducted a randomized experiment during the presidential elections of July 2006 in Sao Tome and Principe. This is a newly found oil-rich West African country that has been facing an increase in ‘retail’ vote buying. Our research design included a randomized campaign against vote buying sponsored by the Electoral Commission of the country, and pre-electoral campaign/post-election panel surveys in treatment (exposed to the campaign) and control locations, including 1034 subjects across 50 different areas. We observe a significant effect of the campaign on perceptions of vote buying, which constitutes the exogenous variation we use to identify effects on voting behavior. We characterize determinants of vote buying (more frequent in swing and rural locations), and find that vote buying energizes the electorate by increasing turnout. Crucially, we capture real effects on candidates’ relative performance, by identifying the challenger to be driving more votes through vote buying (after the treatment), which is consistent with the timeline of events (late challenger candidacy). This result controls for changes in information about the candidates (e.g. policy platforms) and location-specific minutes spent by international electoral observers.},

abstract = {Community Based Development (CBD) and its more recent variant, Community Driven Development (CDD), are among the fastest growing mechanisms for channeling development assistance. To clarify concepts, CBD is an umbrella term that refers to projects which actively include beneficiaries in their design and management. CDD is a term, originally coined by the World Bank, that refers to CBD projects where communities have direct control over key project decisions as well as the management of investment funds.  The remainder of the paper is organized into five sections. In section 2, we preface a review of the evidence by briefly examining the history of participatory development and the move towards CBD as a key mechanism for channeling development assistance. Section 3 examines the literature on participatory development and collective action with a view to understanding what is really meant by ‘participation’ and ‘social capital’, what constitutes a ‘community’, and what are the likely limits and constraints on community participation. In section 4, we review the evidence on the effectiveness of CBD/CDD attempting to answer some of the questions raised above. Section 5 focuses on the feasibility of sustainably scaling up CBD/CDD, and Section 6 concludes by highlighting the main results and identifying the gaps in our knowledge.  Community Based Development relies on “communities” to use their “social capital” to organize themselves and “participate” in development processes. Thus, concepts such as “participation”, “community,” and “social capital” are critical to how CBD/CDD is both conceptualized and implemented. Interestingly, however, handbooks of CBD/CDD, guidelines, and terms of reference, all use the concepts freely and uncritically assuming that they are widely and uniformly understood. What each of these concepts implies is, however, quite controversial. We take them up in turn.  In sum, there are two notes of caution from these studies (like 'participation, the new tyranny?': First, what is labelled a community, is often an ‘endogenous’ construct defined by the parameters of a project, by project facilitators, or by the nature of administrative or identity boundaries-rather than an organic form.6 Second, the effectiveness of participatory strategies may hinge on an explicit understanding of local structures of power since they both limit and enhance the prospects for participatory development.},

abstract = {Political actors inconflict settings are oftenuncertain about their counterparts’ intentions. This article explores the psychology of how intentions are assessed using a novel experimental design that randomly assigns subjects to one of three roles— “proposer,” “recipient,” or “observer.” Recipients and observers are given identical noisy information about proposers’ actions, and make postplay assessments of proposers’ intentions that are rewarded based on accuracy. A first experiment explores a context of ambiguity,while a second experiment explores a context of uncertainty. The results suggest that actors’ perceptions can sometimes be directly affected by the set of strategic alternatives they possess. When signals about proposer behavior appear “negative,” recipients’ assessments of proposers’ intentions are more negative than observers’ assessments if recipients have the ability to respond to the proposer’s action—but not if recipients lack this ability. The ability to respond to proposer behavior appears to cause recipients to make more negative inferences about the proposer than circumstances warrant. Interestingly, recipients’ and observers’ assessments are indistinguishable when signals about proposer behavior instead appear “positive.”},

Existing explanations often ignore the constructivist origins of ethnic group formation, or are too proximate to the outcome under investigation, so that the link between ethnic political competition and ethnic violence is difficult to pick apart. An alternative approach is an explanation of ethnic violence rooted in the microfoundations of social identity theory (SIT). When states consistently employ ethnic categories across institutions, they lay the foundation for conflicts over status and power, facilitating recruitment and mobilization on the basis of emotion-laden intergroup comparisons and competition. The strength of these claims is demonstrated through a comparative-historical analysis of ethnic violence in eleven Southern African countries.},

Evaluating the effects of specific reforms is complicated by the lack of exogenous variation in institutions, the difficulty of measuring institu- tional performance, and the temptation to ‘‘cherry pick’’ estimates from among the large number of indicators required to capture this multifaceted subject. We evaluate one attempt to make local institutions more democratic and egalitar- ian by imposing participation requirements for marginalized groups (including women) and test for learning-by-doing effects. We exploit the random assign- ment of a governance program in Sierra Leone, develop innovative real-world outcome measures, and use a preanalysis plan (PAP) to bind our hands against data mining. The intervention studied is a ‘‘community-driven development’’ program, which has become a popular strategy for foreign aid donors. We find positive short-run effects on local public goods and economic outcomes, but no evidence for sustained impacts on collective action, decision making, or the involvement of marginalized groups, suggesting that the intervention did not durably reshape local institutions. We discuss the practical trade-offs faced in implementing a PAP and show how in its absence we could have generated two divergent, equally erroneous interpretations of program impacts on institutions.

Because winners from initial economic reforms could use their newfound power to block further reform initiatives that might undermine their lucrative positions, escaping the PRE trap required the simultaneous resolution of two conundrums. Policymakers interested in furthering transition needed to both overcome opposition from the concentrated group of early winners and unite a disparate group of potential beneficiaries from future reforms into an alternative coalition. In this article, I rigorously test the theory that Vietnamese reformers managed to solve both dilemmas and to escape their unique partial reform trap through the targeted creation of new provinces in 1996.

This paper draws on work in both political and social psychology to develop a theoretical framework consistent with the federalist view of democratic representation to explain how people make voting decisions. Individuals who were able to vote in elections at all three levels of government (national, state, and local) in 2002 were surveyed, allowing a full test of the federalist voting model. Findings show that while citizens do make distinctions among levels of government when evaluating issues, they only link these distinctions to their voting decisions if those issue attitudes are highly accessible.

abstract = {This article examines the significance of the Legislation Law (lifa fa), passed by the National People's Congress (NPC) in March 2000. The Legislation Law represents an attempt by the NPC to rationalize China's legal system, establish a uniform legislative hierarchy and consolidate its authority over other important lawmaking institutions. The politics behind the Law's development therefore offer insight into the balance of power in China's lawmaking arena, revealing how key institutions – the NPC, the State Council and local people's congresses – engaged in bureaucratic bargaining over fundamental questions of their existence and authority within an evolving system. While the promulgated Law reveals the mixed results of this complex process, it also makes possible a more open and consultative legislative process by sanctioning the emergence of public legislative hearings. Now gaining currency around China, hearings are a new development and could be an important step in institutionalizing more meaningful citizen participation in the legislative process.},

These similarities include the focus on non-political institutions as the determents of political activity and the idea of resources or capital being part of the process leading to participation. Both theories neglect the importance of political institutions and state structure in creating opportunities for and influencing the nature of political participation.

The potential implications are problematic: Ideological camps on the left and right of the political spectrum, with different understandings of politics due to these fundamentally distinct sources of information. We develop a model of media effects given selective exposure and ask whether opinionated political shows polarize viewers. We test our hypotheses using a novel experimental design that requires participants to watch pro-attitudinal and counter-?‐ attitudinal programs in some treatment conditions, but allows others limited choice over what they watch. We find that the polarizing effects of political programs on cable networks dissipate when people can choose across these options or watch entertainment programs. While enabling people to construct an ideologically congruent information environment, media fragmentation also allows those most susceptible to media influence to select out of political information altogether.},

abstract = {The relationship between electoral systems and corruption in a large sample of contemporary democratic nations is analysed in this article. Whereas previous studies have shown that closed-list proportional representation is associated with greater (perceived) corruption than open-list PR, it is demonstrated here that this relationship fails to hold once district magnitude is considered. The theory underlying this study draws on work on \&lsquo;the personal vote\&rsquo; that suggests that the incentives to amass resources \&ndash; and perhaps even to do so illegally \&ndash; increase with district magnitude in open-list settings but decrease in closed-list contexts. Extending this insight, it is shown that political corruption gets more (less) severe as district magnitude increases under open-list PR (closed-list PR) systems. In addition, once district magnitude exceeds a certain threshold \&ndash; the estimates here are that this is as low as fifteen \&ndash; corruption is greater under open lists than closed lists. Only at small district magnitudes (below fifteen) is closed-list PR associated with more corruption, as conventionally held. These results hold for alternative measures of corruption, for different sets of countries analysed, for different measures of district magnitude and regardless of whether the political system is presidential or parliamentary, and of the number of parties.Using an objective measure of corruption in public works contracting, corroborating evidence is also presented from Italian electoral districts. In Italy\&apos;s open-list environment in the period prior to 1994, larger districts were more susceptible to corruption than smaller ones.},

The literature on this phenomenon is, nonetheless, small and suffers from several theoretical and methodological shortcomings; in particular, a unit of analysis problem that causes past studies to mistakenly de-emphasize the importance of local actors. We posit that administrative unit proliferation occurs where and when there is a confluence of interests between the national executive and local citizens and elites from areas that are politically, economically and ethnically marginalized. We argue further that although the proliferation of administrative units often accompanies or follows far-reaching decentralization reforms, it likely results in a recentralization of power; the proliferation of new local governments fragments existing units into smaller ones with lower relative intergovernmental bargaining power and administrative capacity. We find support for these arguments using original data from Uganda.},

Our three-parameter model reconciles prior inconsistent empirical results and argues that low-propensity voters can be effectively mobilized only in high-turnout elections. The model is tested on 11 randomized face-to-face votermobilization field experiments in which we specifically analyze whether subjects’ baseline propensity to vote conditions the effectiveness of door-to-door GOTV canvassing. The evidence is consistent with the model and suggests that face-to-face mobilization is better at stimulating turnout among low-propensity voters in prominent elections than it is in quiescent ones. olitical},

Experimental research designs aim to achieve variation through time and across space while maintaining ceteris paribus assumptions, thus maximizing leverage the into fundamental problem of causal inference. propose We to capture these multiple criteria in a four-fold typology: (1) A Dynamic comparison mirrors laboratory experimentation through the use of both temporal and spatial variation; (2) A Longitudinal comparison employs temporal variation; (3) A Spatial comparison exploits variation through space; and (4) A Counterfactual comparison relies on imagined comparison. All comparison case study research designs can be slotted into one of these four categories. Moreover, the typology illustrates in a concise fashion the ways in which case study research designs attempt to mimic virtues the of experimental design and the degree to which they succeed. The classic experiment, manipulated with treatment and randomized control, provides thus a useful template discussion for about methodological in experimental issues and observational contexts.},

The discussion has been so intense that Chinese officials actually banned further discussion of the topic. The discussions pose an intriguing puzzle for comparative politics; as none of the indices of governance currently available are able to adequately account for the variation that Chinese journalists deem to be so important. The inability of these scales to capture within-typology variation is an important lacuna in our understanding of the behavior of authoritarian regimes. Using this puzzle as our starting point, we focus our analytical lens on accountability mechanisms within the two single-party states, finding significant differences in the distribution of powers within the party apparatus, between party and government, and with government institutions. We also document increasing separation on the openness and competitiveness of elections for the Central Committee and national parliaments. Our findings open up important avenues for research on regime durability and democratic transition.},

In addition, we examine stereotyping by asking whether a person's sex is read as a signal of risk preference. Subjects choose which of five 50/50 gambles they wish to play. The gambles include one sure thing; the remaining four increase (linearly) in expected payoff and risk. Each subject also is asked to guess which of the five gambles each of the other subjects chose, and is paid for correct guesses. The experiment is conducted under three different frames: an abstract frame where the two highest-payoff gambles carry the possibility of losses, an abstract frame with no losses, and an investment frame that mirrors the payoff structure of the former. We find that women are significantly more risk averse than men in all three settings, and predictions of both women and men tend to confirm this difference. While average guesses reflect the average difference in choices, only 27 percent of guesses are accurate, which is slightly higher than chance. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Rapid development of the domestic private sector in communist China and Vietnam has been offered as evidence against a large literature that claims a solid legal infrastructure is required for the financial sector to contribute to economic development. One component of the counterargument holds that relationship-based lending has served as an effective substitute for legal institutions. In this article, we challenge this assertion with empirical findings that show bank credit allocation that relies heavily on "connections" undermines the impact of finance on investment growth. Our data come from Vietnam, where - like China - the private sector and financial sector are expanding dramatically but rule of law has not kept pace. Although Vietnam's banking sector is in transition toward a healthier system, it still allocates a disproportionate share of credit to "connected" enterprises in less competitive regions. We find that political connections, in particular, are an ineffective tool for channeling bank credit to the most profitable investors. Using a two-stage empirical approach, we find evidence that banks place greater value on connections than performance and that the firms with greater access to bank loans are no more profitable than firms without them. By some measures, connected firms are even significantly less profitable. We conclude by demonstrating that the most profitable investors in Vietnam have forgone the formal banking system, preferring to finance their activities out of reinvested earnings or informal loans (JEL G21, G28, G30, O12, K11).},

In particular, we examine the hypothesis that outbidding among insurgent groups results in more suicide terrorism specifically and also more terrorism of any type. A global analysis of terrorism from 1970-2004 provides limited support for Bloom’s thesis related to suicide terrorism. An extension of the argument to all types of terrorist attacks provides even less support for an outbidding thesis. Similar to Pape’s argument, the outbidding thesis has received considerable attention in academic and policy circles. But both hypotheses have received little empirical support and suggest that considerable cross-national work is still needed to understand suicide terror adequately.},

Contrary to expectations, multivariate analysis of survey data demonstrates that citizens who were active in the process were no more supportive of the constitution than those who stayed at home. In-depth interviews reveal that local political leaders, not participation, caused citizens to view the constitution as legitimate or illegitimate. Constitutions are difficult for citizens to evaluate, so they rely on political elites for information and opinions.

We find substantial impacts of the participatory treatment on pupil test scores as well as pupil and teacher absenteeism, while the stan- dard treatment has small and insignificant effects, and we develop a test using randomization inference to show that differences in these joint outcomes between treated groups are statistically significant. Combin- ing this evidence with SMC member behavior in laboratory games, we find evidence that improved collective action explains these differences.

It introduces further evidence and theoretical elaboration supporting Paluck's conclusion that exposure to a reconciliation-themed radio soap opera changed perceptions of social norms and behaviors, not beliefs. Experimental and longitudinal survey evidence reinforces the finding that the radio program affected socially shared perceptions of typical or prescribed behavior-that is, social norms. Specifically, measurements of perceptions of social norms called into question by Staub and Pearlman are shown to correlate with perceptions of public opinion and public, not private, behaviors. Although measurement issues and the mechanisms of the radio program's influence merit further testing, theory and evidence point to social interactions and emotional engagement, not individual education, as the likely mechanisms of change. The present exchange makes salient what is at stake in this debate: a model of change based on learning and personal beliefs versus a model based on group influence and social norms. These theoretical models recommend very different strategies for prejudice and conflict reduction. Future field experiments should attempt to adjudicate between these models by testing relevant policies in real-world settings.},

abstract = {<p>Campaigns rely upon both paid and volunteer phone calls to mobilize voters. Pastfield experiments show calls from volunteers to increase turnout and paid calls to be wholly ineffective. This article argues that the quality of phone calls rather than the presence or absence of a payroll explains this regularity. Three aspects of quality are considered: monitoring pace and interactivity, timing, and message. A fully randomized field experiment with over 100,000 subjects comparing professional and volunteer phone banks simultaneously was conducted during the 2002 congressional elections to test this hypothesis.

abstract = {A theory of deliberation must provide a plausible account both of individuals’ choices to speak or to listen and of how they reinterpret their own views in the aftermath of deliberation. We describe a game-theoretic laboratory experiment in which subjects with diverse interests speak or listen before voting over a common outcome. An important feature of our strategic setting is that introspective agents may, upon hearing an unpersuasive argument, update away from the speaker's preferred position. While subjects are responsive to strategic incentives, they also deviate from Bayesian predictions by “overspeaking” when speech is likelier to alienate than persuade. Subjects thus come closer to the deliberative democratic ideal of a free exchange of arguments than equilibrium predictions suggest. We interpret evidence from subjects’ deliberative choices and policy votes in terms of a cognitive hierarchy among subjects, defined by differing abilities to grasp the strategic implications of different kinds of information.},

Does greater trans- parency improve political accountability? We use a simple model of political account- ability to derive a set of hypotheses linking access to information to political behavior and provide results from a multi-level field experiment designed to test these hypotheses in the context of parliamentary behavior in Uganda. Between 2006 and 2011, working with a Ugandan partner, we developed a scorecard with detailed information on the performance of Ugandan Members of Parliament (MPs), informed a randomly selected sample of MPs that the information would be disseminated in their constituencies, and provided voters with information about their MP’s performance through a variety of dissemination channels. Evidence from survey experiments indicates that Ugandan voters are strongly receptive to new information about the performance of their MPs. Evidence from the dissemination campaigns, however, provides no evidence that MPs respond to a higher level of transparency with improved performance or that their prospects for reelection are threatened by it.},

abstract = {Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important element of the global economy and a central component of economic development strategies of both developed and developing countries. Numerous scholars theorize that the economic benefits of attracting multinational corporations come at tremendous political costs, arguing that democratic political systems attract lower levels of international investment than their authoritarian counterparts. Using both cross-sectional and time-series cross-sectional tests of the determinants of FDI for more than 100 countries, I generate results that are inconsistent with these dire predictions. Democratic political systems attract higher levels of FDI inflows both across countries and within countries over time. Democratic countries are predicted to attract as much as 70 percent more FDI than their authoritarian counterparts. In a final empirical test, I examine how democratic institutions affect country credibility by empirically analyzing the link between democracy and sovereign debt risk for about eighty countries from 1980 to 1998. These empirical tests challenge the conventional wisdom on the preferences of multinationals for authoritarian regimes.Special thanks to Geoffrey Garrett for his extensive comments on this project and a number of other related projects on the determinants of foreign direct investment.

We investigate the role that incomplete information with respect to the intrinsic moral cost of one's potential corruption partner plays out in his or her propensity to engage in bribery, and, consequently, the equilibrium level of corruption in the society. We assume that the cost of engaging in corruption is subject to strategic complementarities, which may lead to multiple corruption equilibria. We find that corruption is lowest when potential bribers and potential bribees are uncertain regarding each other's " corruptibility" and have asymmetric bargaining powers. Our uncertainty result provides theoretical support in favor of anti-corruption strategies, such as staff rotation in public offices, aimed at decreasing the social closeness of bribers and bribees. Our bargaining power result suggests that, under uncertainty, monopolistic public good provision has the same corruption-reducing effect as competitive public good provision. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Yet ethno-linguistic cleavages also played an important role in the transition to democracy, and they arguably shape the character of electoral competition today. To assess the relative weight of racial, class, and linguistic ties in shaping political preferences, I conducted an experiment with a probability sample of residents of Johannesburg and Cape Town, in which participants were shown similar videotaped political speeches by actors of varying race, native language, and stated class backgrounds. On average, I find strong race effects, some evidence for language effects, and perhaps counterintuitive class effects. Most interesting are the results for distinct sub-groups. There is strong evidence of a race effect for Whites and none for Blacks, while language effects appear to be stronger for linguistic groups that have arguably wielded less political power in the post-apartheid period.

Focusing on the relationship between trade and investment, we argue that international trade agreements—GATT/WTO and preferential trade agreements (PTAs)—provide mechanisms for making commitments to foreign investors about the treatment of their assets, thus reassuring investors and increasing investment. These international commitments are more credible than domestic policy choices, because reneging on them is more costly. Statistical analyses for 122 developing countries from 1970 to 2000 support this argument. Developing countries that belong to the WTO and participate in more PTAs experience greater FDI inflows than otherwise, controlling for many factors including domestic policy preferences and taking into account possible endogeneity. Joining international trade agreements allows developing countries to attract more FDI and thus increase economic growth.},

abstract = {There is a renewed interest in how political risk affects multinational corporations operating in emerging markets. Much of this research has focused on the relationship between democratic institutions and flows of foreign direct investment (FDI). Yet the existing studies suffer from data problems that only allow for indirect evidence of the relationship between political institutions and political risk. In this paper I utilize price data from political risk insurance agencies to directly test how domestic political institutions affect the premiums multinationals pay for coverage against government expropriations and contract disputes. I find that democratic regimes reduce risks for multinational investors, specifically through increasing constraints on the executive. Utilizing qualitative evidence from investors, insurers, and location consultants, I explore the mechanisms linking democratic regimes with lower levels of political risk.

abstract = {(from the chapter) It is more common to associate mass media with conflict than with social, political, or economic reconstruction. Ready at hand are examples of Holocaust propaganda, negative media portrayals of minorities during war and genocide in Bosnia, Serbia, and Rwanda, and ethnic propaganda via SMS and blogging in Kenya during its election violence. Media that incite conflict are not only attention-grabbing, they seem to work. For example, a recent analysis of Rwandan hate radio leading up to and during the genocide pins at least 9 percent, or 45,000 deaths, on hate radio broadcasts. However, media are also used for building peaceful social relations and for reconstructing communities economically and politically. Psychologists, who have studied how media can promote stereotyping, prejudice, and conflict, also study how media help to reconstruct communities. The social-psychological mechanisms supposed to underlie media aimed at reconstruction are in many cases similar to those thought to underlie conflict media. These mechanisms include individual cognitive, emotional, and motivational responses to media, in addition to facets of interpersonal communication and social influence sparked by media. This chapter takes the position that the design of media interventions should be informed by these psychological theories, and that psychologists can expand on their theories through the study of real-world media interventions. I begin by reviewing the types of media interventions most commonly launched to rebuild communities following conflict. I focus in particular on media that broadcast "public narratives." Public narratives are stories portrayed by news media, films, theater, and in radio or television dramas. After reviewing examples of media interventions that use public narratives to rebuild communities, I review the social-psychological theories that seek to explain media influence. I then describe two studies of post-conflict media interventions that tested some of these theoretical explanations. The chapter concludes with recommendations for theory and research supporting media efforts to rebuild communities following conflict. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).},

However, under certain circumstances, aggregate public opinion may be a poor reflection of collective public sentiment. I argue that it may be dif- ficult to gauge true aggregate public sentiment on certain socially sensitive issues. My analysis of NES data from 1992 reveals that public opinion polls overstate support for government efforts to integrate schools. Specifically, selection bias models reveal that some individuals who harbor anti-integrationist sentiments are likely to hide their so- cially unacceptable opinions behind a "don't know" response. As an independent confir- mation of the selection bias correction technique, I find that the same methods which pre- dict that opinion polls understate opposition to school integration also predict the results of the 1989 New York City mayoral election more accurately than the marginals of pre- election tracking polls.},

Existing explanations of pre-electoral fiscal manipulation focus primarily on domestic characteristics. We extend this line of inquiry by examining international influences on governments’ decisions to engage in pre-electoral fiscal manipulation. We find that international scrutiny of the economy and international scrutiny of elections affect pre-electoral fiscal manipulation in cross-cutting ways. Using data from 1990 to 2004 for 94 developing countries, we show that pre-electoral fiscal manipulation is more likely when international election monitors make direct election manipulation more difficult, and it is less likely when governments are subject to international economic scrutiny resulting from an IMF agreement.},

The tanh estimator provides accurate estimates and reliable inferences even when the specified model is not good for as much as half of the data. Seriously ill-fitted counts - outliers - are identified as part of the estimation. A Monte Carlo sampling experiment shows that the tanh estimator produces good results at practical sample sizes even when ten percent of the data are generated by a significantly different process. The experiment shows that, with contaminated data, estimation fails using four other estimators: the nonrobust maximum likelihood estimator, the additive logistic model and two SUR models. Using the tanh estimator to analyze data from Florida for the 2000 presidential election matches well-known features of the election that the other four estimators fail to capture. In an analysis of data from the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, the tanh estimator gives sharper inferences than does a previously proposed heteroskedastic SUR model.$\backslash$n},

Combining "lab-in-the-field" experiments with observational data on 1,541 Ugandan farmers from 50 communities, we demonstrate the positive effect of internal centralized sanctioning authorities on cooperative behavior. We also show that the size of this effect depends on the political process by which authority is granted: subjects electing leaders contribute more to public goods than subjects who were assigned leaders through a lottery. To test the ecological validity of our findings, we relate farmers' behavior in the experiment to their level of cooperation in their community organization. We show that deference to authority in the controlled setting predicts cooperative behavior in the farmers' natural environment, in which they face a similar social dilemma.},

We conceptualize two types of foreign intervention: a partisan stance, where the outsider roots for a particular candidate slate, and a process stance, where outsiders support the democratic process. We theorize that a partisan outside message will polarize partisan actors domestically on the issue of appropriate relations with the outsiders: partisans who are supported will want closer relations with the outside power, and partisans who are opposed will favor more distant relations. A process message, in contrast, will have a moderating effect on voters’ attitudes. We present evidence of partisan polarization along those lines from a survey experiment we conducted in Lebanon in the wake of the 2009 parliamentary elections. We discuss the implications of our findings for future studies of how outsiders can encourage moderate electoral outcomes in democratizing states.},

It does so by taking advantage of the natural experiment afforded by the division of the Chewa and Tumbuka peoples by the border between Zambia and Malawi. I document that, while the objective cultural differences between Chewas and Tumbukas on both sides of the border are identical, the political salience of the division between these communities is altogether different. I argue that this difference stems from the different sizes of the Chewa and Tumbuka communities in each country relative to each country's national political arena. In Malawi, Chewas and Tumbukas are each large groups vis-\`{a}-vis the country as a whole and, thus, serve as viable bases for political coalition-building. In Zambia, Chewas and Tumbukas are small relative to the country as a whole and, thus, not useful to mobilize as bases of political support. The analysis suggests that the political salience of a cultural cleavage depends not on the nature of the cleavage itself (since it is identical in both countries) but on the sizes of the groups it defines and whether or not they will be useful vehicles for political competition.},

For this purpose, we use a natural experiment framework which contrasts Sao Tome and Principe to Cape Verde, a control West African country sharing the same colonial past and important recent economic and political shocks. Our measurement is based on tailored household surveys we conducted in both island countries. The unique survey instrument was retrospective and used personal histories to elicit memories from the respondents. We analyze changes in perceived corruption across a wide range of public services and allocations. We find clearest increases on vote buying, education (namely in the allocation of scholarships) and customs, ranging from 31 to 40\% of the subjective scale. We interpret these findings as symptoms of increased competition for core state resources. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this research note, I argue that a recent focus on "moral hazard" has distracted attention from another mechanism linking foreign aid to domestic political institutions. During the Cold War, donors' geopolitical objectives diminished the credibility of threats to condition aid on the adoption of democratic reforms. The demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, on the other hand, enhanced the effectiveness of Western aid conditionality. I reanalyze an important recent study and demonstrate that the small positive effect of foreign aid on democracy in sub-Saharan African countries between 1975 and 1997 is limited to the post-Cold War period. This new empirical evidence underscores the importance of geopolitical context in conditioning the causal impact of development assistance, and the evidence confirms that the end of the Cold War marked a watershed in the politics of foreign aid in Africa.},

This paper studies the determinants of the world pattern of legal and illegal corruption by proposing a simple theoretical model of endogenous corruption and related legal framework, and its thorough empirical test. Three types of equilibrium outcomes are identified: one based on illegal corruption, where the elite does not face any binding incentives to limit corruption; one centered around legal corruption, where the elite must incur a cost to legally protect corruption; and finally a no-corruption outcome, where the population is able to effectively react to corruption. Testable implications from the model are derived based on country-wide parameters. Crucially, we use a rich corporate survey, including 8,279 firms in 104 countries, tailored for this research, and featuring measures of legal corruption that are novel to the literature. The microdimension of the database enables improving on familiar shortcomings associated with the use of endogeneity-prone, country-wide indices of perceived corruption. The empirical results, making use of a broad range of proxies and sources, generally validate the model's explanations.},

abstract = {<p>Although not widely known until much later, Al Gore received 202 more votes than George W. Bush on election day in Florida. George W. Bush is president because he overcame his election day deficit with overseas absentee ballots that arrived and were counted after election day. In the final official tally, Bush received 537 more votes than Gore. These numbers are taken from the official results released by the Florida Secretary of State’s office and so do not reflect overvotes, undervotes, unsuccessful litigation, butterfly ballot problems, recounts that might have been allowed but were not, or any other hypothetical divergence between voter preferences and counted votes. After the election, the New York Times conducted a six month long investigation and found that 680 of the overseas absentee ballots were illegally counted, and no partisan, pundit, or academic has publicly disagreed with their assessment. In this paper, we describe the statistical procedures we developed and implemented for the Times to ascertain whether disqualifying these 680 ballots would have changed the outcome of the election. The methods involve adding formal Bayesian model averaging procedures to King’s (1997) ecological inference model. Formal Bayesian model averaging has not been used in political science but is especially useful when substantive conclusions depend heavily on apparently minor but indefensible model choices, when model generalization is not feasible, and when potential critics are more partisan than academic. We show how we derived the results for the Times so that other scholars can use these methods to make ecological inferences for other purposes. We also present a variety of new empirical results that delineate the precise conditions under which Al Gore would have been elected president, and offer new evidence of the striking effectiveness of the Republican effort to convince local election officials to count invalid ballots in Bush counties and not count them in Gore counties.</p>},

abstract = {Vote buying has and continues to be pervasive in many electoral regimes. Yet the relationship between vote buying and voting behavior, particularly in the context of the secret ballot, remains largely unknown. In this paper I study the effect of vote buying on voter turnout in Kenya, using a nationally representative survey that includes questions about the country's 2002 presidential and parliamentary elections. Estimating the causal effect of vote buying on voter turnout is complicated by its strategic nature, and so this study also examines the strategic logic of vote buying in Kenya. The results suggest that poor individuals and “swing” voters in the country's most electorally competitive districts are vote buyers most likely targets. Using these results, I use matching to estimate that individuals who were approached by a vote buyer were about 14 percentage points more likely to vote than those who were not, while the least educated individuals were the most highly influenced by vote-buying. These results present a puzzle. If voting is secret and voluntary, why does vote buying have this impact? I propose and test the empirical implications of three explanations: individual monitoring, community-level monitoring, and credibility signaling. Evidence is consistent with individual monitoring and credibility signaling, though not with community-level monitoring: vote buying influences perceptions of party monitoring and involvement in violence, and improves perceptions of party credibility.},

Yet although the empirical connection between ethnic heterogeneity and the underprovision of public goods is widely accepted, there is little consensus on the specific mechanisms through which this relationship operates. We identify three families of mechanisms that link diversity to public goods provision – what we term “preferences,” “technology,” and “strategy selection” mechanisms – and run a series of experimental games that permit us to compare the explanatory power of distinct mecha- nisms within each of these three families. Results from games conducted with a random sample of 300 subjects from a slum neighborhood of Kampala, Uganda, suggest that successful public goods provision in homogenous ethnic communities can be attributed to a strategy selectionmechanism: in similar settings, co-ethnics play cooperative equilibria, whereas non-co-ethnics do not. In addition, we find evidence for a technology mechanism: co-ethnics aremore closely linked on social networks and thus plausibly better able to support cooperation through the threat of social sanction. We find no evidence for prominent preference mechanisms that emphasize the commonality of tastes within ethnic groups or a greater degree of altruism toward co-ethnics, and only weak evidence for technology mechanisms that focus on the impact of shared ethnicity on the productivity of teams.},

Evaluating the effects of specific reforms is complicated by the lack of exogenous variation in institutions, the difficulty of measuring institu- tional performance, and the temptation to ‘‘cherry pick’’ estimates from among the large number of indicators required to capture this multifaceted subject. We evaluate one attempt to make local institutions more democratic and egalitar- ian by imposing participation requirements for marginalized groups (including women) and test for learning-by-doing effects. We exploit the random assign- ment of a governance program in Sierra Leone, develop innovative real-world outcome measures, and use a preanalysis plan (PAP) to bind our hands against data mining. The intervention studied is a ‘‘community-driven development’’ program, which has become a popular strategy for foreign aid donors. We find positive short-run effects on local public goods and economic outcomes, but no evidence for sustained impacts on collective action, decision making, or the involvement of marginalized groups, suggesting that the intervention did not durably reshape local institutions. We discuss the practical trade-offs faced in implementing a PAP and show how in its absence we could have generated two divergent, equally erroneous interpretations of program impacts on institutions.

abstract = {What happens to a society that has too many men? In this provocative book, Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer argue that, historically, high male-to-female ratios often trigger domestic and international violence. Most violent crime is committed by young unmarried males who lack stable social bonds. Although there is not always a direct cause-and-effect relationship, these surplus men often play a crucial role in making violence prevalent within society. Governments sometimes respond to this problem by enlisting young surplus males in military campaigns and high-risk public works projects. Countries with high male-to-female ratios also tend to develop authoritarian political systems.

Hudson and den Boer suggest that the sex ratios of many Asian countries, particularly China and India -- which represent almost 40 percent of the world's population -- are being skewed in favor of males on a scale that may be unprecedented in human history. Through offspring sex selection (often in the form of sex-selective abortion and female infanticide), these countries are acquiring a disproportionate number of low-status young adult males, called "bare branches" by the Chinese.

Hudson and den Boer argue that this surplus male population in Asia's largest countries threatens domestic stability and international security. The prospects for peace and democracy are dimmed by the growth of bare branches in China and India, and, they maintain, the sex ratios of these countries will have global implications in the twenty-first century.},

This research uses two planned treatments, the first involving a signaling condition concerning a subject's "type," and the second a price effect built into the structure of the game.

This article explores the constellation of factors that together led to a constitutional succession after President Bingu wa Mutharika’s death in Malawi, despite plotting by the late President’s allies to circumvent the constitution and install their own candidate over Vice-President Joyce Banda. We present data on execu- tive deaths in office since 1961 and executive transfers of power 2010–12 in order to situate the Malawi transition within the broader African context, and draw especially on comparisons to executive successions that followed the death-in-office of presidents in Nigeria (2010) and Zambia (2008). We assert from these cases that constitutional provisions on executive succession are necessary in precipitating peaceful transi- tions, but also argue that periods of delay indicate that such provisions are insufficient on their own. We contend that presidential death is more likely to lead to transition than presidential incapacity. The Malawian case in particular illustrates how a constitutional transition requires support from key actors, particularly the Cabinet, military leaders, judi- ciary, civil society, and the independent media. Public rejection of mili- tary or authoritarian rule, and the growing precedent for constitutional succession in Africa, are additional drivers of peaceful transitions.},

abstract = {The widespread presence of local conflict characterizes many developing countries such as Indonesia. Outbreaks of violent conflict not only have direct costs for lives, livelihoods, and material property, but may also have the potential to escalate further. Recent studies on large-scale “headline” conflicts have tended to exclude the systematic consideration of local conflict, in large part due to the absence of representative data at low levels of geographic specification. This paper is a first attempt to correct for that. We evaluate a unique dataset compiled by the Indonesian government, the periodic Village Potential Statistics (PODES), which seeks to map conflict across all of Indonesia’s 69,000 villages/neighborhoods. The data confirm that conflict is prevalent beyond well publicized “conflict regions,” and that it can be observed across the archipelago. The data report largely violent conflict in 7.1 percent of Indonesia’s lowest administrative tier (rural desa and urban kelurahan). Integrating examples from qualitative fieldwork, we assess issues in the measurement of local conflict for quantitative analysis, and adopt an empirical framework to examine potential associations with poverty, inequality, shocks, ethnic and religious diversity/inequality, and community-level associational and security arrangements. The quantitative analysis shows positive correlations between local conflict and unemployment, inequality, natural disasters, changes in sources of incomes, and clustering of ethnic groups within villages. The institutional variables indicate that the presence of places of worship is associated with less conflict, while the presence of religious groups and traditional culture (adat) institutions are associated with conflict. We conclude by suggesting future areas of research, notably on the role of group inequality and inference, and suggest ways to improve the measurement of conflict in the village census},

Based on recent empirical evidence of post-civil war democratization in El Salvador, Mozambique, and elsewhere, I show that democracy can arise directly from anarchy. Predatory warring factions choose the citizenry and democratic procedures over a Leviathan when (1) their economic interests depend on productive investment by the citizens, (2) citizens' political preferences ensure that power allocation will be less biased under democracy than under a Leviathan, and (3) there is an external agency (e.g., the United Nations) that mediates and supervises joint disarmament and state-building. Ultimately, I discuss the implications of this argument for the basic intuitions of classical political theory and contemporary social theory regarding democratization and authoritarianism.},

How do exist-ing theories about trade policy explain this puzzle? Three sets of explana-tions are prominent. First, many focus on changes in trade policy preferences among domestic actors, either societal groups or political leaders. Second, scholars examine changes in political institutions to account for such policy change. Third, they seek explanations in changes in the international politi-cal system. Large-scale changes in political institutions, especially in the direction of democracy, may be necessary for the kind of massive trade liber-alization that has occurred. But changes in preferences cannot be overlooked in explaining the rush to free trade. Moreover, the influence of international institutions has been important. Finally, the reciprocal impact of trade on do-mestic politics and the international political system is important. If the rush to free trade is sustained, will its impact be benign or malign?},

Furthermore, we conduct an exploratory analysis of six separate cases that have elements of comparability but also occur in unique contexts, which illustrate some of the patterns in terrorism and civil war.

The analysis reveals that if incumbents maximize their probability of victory rather than vote share, campaigns by typical incumbents are expected to produce only minimal improvement in incumbent vote share. The analysis also explains how returns to campaign spending vary with the competitiveness of the election, how incumbent spending can improve the incumbent's probability of victory yet have only minimal effect on incumbent vote share, and why rational spending plans might decrease the sponsor's expected vote.

Vladimir Putin's creeping authoritarianism acts as a "natural experiment" where we can study collective action before, during, and after the introduction of restrictive measures. Two key findings emerge. First, despite the Kremlin's increasingly heavy hand, antiwar actions have grown in size and frequency over the course of Putin's tenure. Second, the movement's failure to replicate its Yeltsin-era success in forcing a peace, albeit temporary, in Chechnya is due to organizational culture, not state repression. Indeed, the antiwar movement's prevailing cultural norms have undercut mobilization by locking activists into using symbolic appeals that ring hollow among Russians. Activists are thus unable to wield latent antiwar sentiment as a cudgel to entrap the Kremlin into reversing course. This argument is supported by a protest data set, primary documents, interviews, and participant observation.},

Gender assorting was significant and considerable when grouping was perfectly enforced or depended on social enforcement. There was significantly less gender assorting when grouping depended on trust.

My main proposition is that its spread has been driven by neither technological nor economic factors alone. Rather, political factors exert a powerful influence. Groups that believe they will lose from the Internet use political institutions to enact policies that block the spread of the Internet. Some political institutions make this easier than others. Data from roughly 190 countries from 1991 to 2001 showthat a country's regime type matters greatly, even when controlling for other economic, technological, political, and sociological factors. Democratic governments facilitate the spread of the Internet relative to autocratic ones. Thus, the spread of democracy may help reduce the digital divide.},

Extending the analysis, we include a control for on-the-job-training and find that it does not attenuate the seniority profile, which is also at odds with human capital theory. We do find however that firm characteristics play an important role. Wage-seniority profiles are steeper in large firms, but performance profiles are not, suggesting that the results from Medoff and Abraham are specific to large firms. We then assess the role of education. Our results confirm that education is important for the allocation to job levels. Using data on cognitive ability, we also find that the effect of education on wages is at least partially because it signals cognitive ability. We also find evidence that the returns to education are not related to performance, while the returns to cognitive ability are. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pre-election opinion poll results for U.S. presidential contests have large variation in the early parts of the primary campaigns, yet pre-election opinion polls later in the campaign are typically within several percentage points of the actual outcome of the contest in November. This paper argues this trend demonstrates that voters are beginning to poll "correctly" - that is, to ascertain their most-preferred candidate. This convergence process is consistent with boundedly rational voters making decisions with low information. We examine the process by which voters can use opinion polls to guide their candidate choice. We undertake a series of laboratory experiments where uninformed voters choose between two candidates after participating in a series of pre-election polls. We demonstrate that voters update their beliefs about candidate locations using information contained in the opinion polls. We compare two behavioral models for the updating process and find significant evidence to support a boundedly rational Bayesian updating assumption. This assumption about the updating process is key to many theoretical results which argue that voters have the potential to aggregate information via a coordination signal and for their beliefs to converge to the true state of the world. This finding also indicates that uninformed voters are able to use pre-election polls to help them make correct decisions. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {When evaluating political candidates, citizens can draw on partisan stereotypes and use partisan cues to make inferences about the candidates’ issue positions without undertaking a costly information search. As long as candidates adopt policy positions that are congruent with partisan stereotypes, partisan cues can help citizens make an accurate voting decision with limited information. However, if candidates take counter-stereotypical positions, it is incumbent upon citizens to recognize it and adjust their evaluations accordingly. Using the dual-processing framework, I hypothesize about the conditions under which individuals reduce their reliance on partisan cues and scrutinize counter-stereotypical messages, and test these hypotheses with experimental data collected from a nationally representative sample of adults. The findings show that whether individuals punish a candidate from their party for taking a counter-stereotypical position is contingent on the salience of the issue and the political awareness of the message recipient. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and normative implications of these findings.},

Psychological research on descriptive social norms suggests that emphasizing the opposite—that many do vote—would be a more effective message. In two get-out-the-vote field experiments, we find that messages emphasizing low expected turnout are less effective at motivating voters than messages emphasizing high expected turnout. The findings suggest that descriptive social norms affect vote intention only among citizens who vote infrequently or occasionally. Practically, the results suggest that voter mobilization efforts should emphasize high turnout, especially when targeting occasional and low rate of participation voters. More generally, our findings suggest that the common lamentation by the media and politicians regarding low participation may undermine turnout.},

abstract = {The poor conservation outcomes that followed decades of intrusive resource management strategies and planned development have forced policy makers and scholars to reconsider the role of community in resource use and conservation. In a break from previous work on development which considered communities a hindrance to progressive social change, current writings champion the role of community in bringing about decentralization, meaningful participation, and conservation. But despite its recent popularity, the concept of community is rarely defined or carefully examined by those concerned with resource use and management. We seek to redress this omission by investigating 'community' in work concerning resource conservation and management. We explore the conceptual origins of the community, and the ways the term has been deployed in writings on resource use. We then analyze those aspects of community most important to advocates for community's role in resource management - community as a small spatial unit, as a homogeneous social structure, and as shared norms - and indicate the weaknesses of these approaches. Finally, we suggest a more political approach: community must be examined in the context of development and conservation by focusing on the multiple interests and actors within communities, on how these actors influence decision-making, and on the internal and external institutions that shape the decision-making process. A focus on institutions rather than 'community' is likely to be more fruitful for those interested in community-based natural resource management.},

abstract = {During the nineteenth century, states routinely defeated insurgent foes. Over the twentieth century, however, this pattern reversed itself, with states increasingly less likely to defeat insurgents or avoid meeting at least some of their demands. What accounts for this pattern of outcomes in counterinsurgency (COIN) wars? We argue that increasing mechanization within state militaries after World War I is primarily responsible for this shift. Unlike their nineteenth-century predecessors, modern militaries possess force structures that inhibit information collection among local populations. This not only complicates the process of sifting insurgents from noncombatants but increases the difficulty of selectively applying rewards and punishment among the fence-sitting population. Modern militaries may therefore inadvertently fuel, rather than deter, insurgencies. We test this argument with a new data set of 286 insurgencies (1800–2005) and a paired comparison of two U.S. Army divisions in Iraq (2003–2004). We find that higher levels of mechanization, along with external support for insurgents and the counterinsurgent's status as an occupier, are associated with an increased probability of state defeat. By contrast, we find only partial support for conventional power- and regime-based explanations, and no support for the view that rough terrain favors insurgent success.},

Rather, the variations appear to be due simply to a lack of familiarity and to the consequentially greater uncertainty faced by resettled villagers when trying to predict each other’s behaviour in strategic situations. The most likely reasons for this relate to the difference in the density of kinship networks in the two types of village. In resettled villages they are less dense.},

Using census data, this report provides a profile of youth in Canada. This demonstrates the most important differences between those under 30 years of age and those over 30. We then consider the relationship between various factors and the decision to vote among Canadian youth. Following this, we perform a cohort analysis to show how youth electoral participation has evolved over time. In these analyses, we distinguish two youth groups, those aged 18–24 and those 25–30, whom we compare to all other age groups. We finally examine the factors that seem to affect Canadian youths’ decision to vote or not to vote. We briefly summarize existing research in the area, particularly in Canada but also abroad, with a view to establishing the state of knowledge, the major gaps that exist and the most promising avenues for further research. We find that Canadian youth are different from their older counterparts. They are less likely to be married, somewhat better educated and slightly less religious. They earn less income. But they are more likely to have been born in Canada. Of these socio-demographic factors, education and origin (i.e. being born in Canada) are the most powerful predictors of voting. But the most crucial determinants are interest in politics and information about politics. Our cohort analysis suggests that most of the decline in voter turnout is attributable to decline among younger generations. After reviewing the current knowledge on the causes of declining youth turnout, we suggest future studies that could identify solutions to address this decline.},

abstract = {In the social sciences, randomized experimentation is the optimal research design for establishing causation. However, for a number of practical reasons, researchers are sometimes unable to conduct experiments and must rely on observational data. In an effort to develop estimators that can approximate experimental results using observational data, scholars have given increasing attention to matching. In this article, we test the performance of matching by gauging the success with which matching approximates experimental results. The voter mobilization experiment presented here comprises a large number of observations (60,000 randomly assigned to the treatment group and nearly two million assigned to the control group) and a rich set of covariates. This study is analyzed in two ways. The first method, instrumental variables estimation, takes advantage of random assignment in order to produce consistent estimates. The second method, matching estimation, ignores random assignment and analyzes the data as though they were nonexperimental. Matching is found to produce biased results in this application because even a rich set of covariates is insufficient to control for preexisting differences between the treatment and control group. Matching, in fact, produces estimates that are no more accurate than those generated by ordinary least squares regression. The experimental findings show that brief paid get-out-the-vote phone calls do not increase turnout, while matching and regression show a large and significant effect.},

Results suggest that public access to information and use of media outlets may not only make governments more responsive, but also shape voters' demand for growth-promoting policies. Paradoxically, ethnic ties between voters and candidates can increase the demand for national public goods.

A predominant approach has been to use linear structural equation models and examine the statistical significance of the corresponding path coefficients. However, this approach implicitly assumes that the multiple mechanisms are causally independent of one another. In this article, we consider a set of alternative assumptions that are sufficient to identify the average causal mediation effects when multiple, causally related mediators exist. We develop a new sensitivity analysis for examining the robustness of empirical findings to the potential violation of a key identification assumption. We apply the proposed methods to three political psychology experiments, which examine alternative causal pathways between media framing and public opinion. Our analysis reveals that the validity of original conclusions is highly reliant on the assumed independence of alternative causal mechanisms, highlighting the importance of proposed sensitivity analysis.

abstract = {Influenced by Amartya Sen, over the last decade, The World Bank has allocated nearly US\$80 billion to local participatory development projects targeting poverty, improved public service delivery, and strengthened social cohesion and government accountability. But the success of these programs is hindered by both endogenous local factors and flawed program design and implementation. Two especially important local obstacles are (1) entrenched interests of political agents, civil bureaucrats, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with either incentives to resist or capabilities to appropriate program resources, and (2) poverty and illiteracy, as the poor and illiterate participate less and benefit less from participatory projects than do the wealthier, more educated, and more connected. After reviewing hundreds of participatory projects, three lessons are clear for program planning. First, contextual factors like inequality, history, geography, and political systems (among others) are important. Second, communities do not necessarily have a ready stock of 'social capital' to mobilize. Third, induced participatory interventions work best when supported by a responsive state -- donors cannot substitute for a non-functional state, and successful programs combine enlightened state action from above with social mobilization from below. Future participatory development projects would benefit substantially from revised planning and considerably more attention paid to evaluation and monitoring. Project managers have historically paid little attention to context, monitoring, or evaluation, in part because The World Bank's operational policies did not provide incentives to do so. Donor agencies should also exercise greater patience and allow for flexible, long-term engagement to facilitate contextual and programmatic learning, including learning from failure.

New suggestive evidence on the variation of public spending composition across states, and within states over time is offered that is consistent with this argument. This evidence underscores a growing argument in the development literature that the level and composition of public spending per se may not be sufficient metrics to assess the quality of public goods policies—greater infrastructure spending in some contexts may go to political rents rather than to the actual delivery of broad public goods for growth and poverty reduction.},

We provide a data set of all national elections between 1945 and 2006 and a measure of whether each election event is structured such that the competition is possible. We outline the pitfalls of other measures used by scholars to define the potential for electoral competition and show that such methods can lead to biased or incomplete findings.

Important empirical anomalies may be resolved by analyzing the effects of union centralization and monopoly separately, rather than combining them into a composite index of corporatism.

Nonpartisan get-out-the-vote messages were conveyed through personal canvassing, direct mail, and telephone calls shortly before the November 1998 election. A variety of substantive messages were used. Voter turnout was increased substantially by personal canvassing, slightly by direct mail, and not at all by telephone calls. These findings support our hypothesis that the long-term retrenchment in voter turnout is partly attributable to the decline in face-to-face political mobilization.},

Extending implications of theories of legislative behavior to the context of open-list proportional representation, we examine whether individually powerful legislators and ruling parties direct spending to core or marginal electoral districts and whether opposition parties share resources via a norm of universalism. We show that when districts elect politically more powerful deputies from the governing parties, they receive more investments. We interpret this as indicating that legislators with political resources reward their core voters by investing in public works in their districts. The governing parties, by contrast, are not able to discipline their own members of parliament sufficiently to target the parties' areas of core electoral strength. Finally, we find no evidence that a norm of universalism operates to steer resources to areas when the main opposition party gains more votes.},

Combining "lab-in-the-field" experiments with observational data on 1,541 Ugandan farmers from 50 communities, we demonstrate the positive effect of internal centralized sanctioning authorities on cooperative behavior. We also show that the size of this effect depends on the political process by which authority is granted: subjects electing leaders contribute more to public goods than subjects who were assigned leaders through a lottery. To test the ecological validity of our findings, we relate farmers' behavior in the experiment to their level of cooperation in their community organization. We show that deference to authority in the controlled setting predicts cooperative behavior in the farmers' natural environment, in which they face a similar social dilemma.},

She then shows how clarifying candidates tend to win on account of the importance and amorphous nature of the economy, but also that candidates who follow her framework are far more succesful than those who don't, and that this impact can be shown in the aggregate (with forecasting models) as well as at the individual level.},

abstract = {We use original survey data and administrative data from post-war Liberia to test a theory of the micro-level impacts of peacekeeping. The theory proposes that through the creation of local security bubbles and also through direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to economic and social revitalization that may contribute to more durable peace. This theory guides the design of current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping's well-documented association with more durable peace. We identify local impacts of deployment bases by exploiting the fact that peacekeepers had limited information when selecting base localities, using coarsened exact matching to identify sets of communities that should have been equally likely to receive bases, and then using regression to clean up residual imbalances. Our evidence paint a complex picture that deviates substantially from the theory. We do not find evidence for local security bubbles around deployment base areas, and we do not find that deployments were substantial contributors to local social infrastructure. In addition, we find a negative relationship between deployment basing locations and NGO contributions to social infrastructure. Nonetheless, we find that deployments do seem to stimulate local markets, leading to better employment possibilities and substantially higher incomes. The result is something of a puzzle, suggesting that more work needs to be done on other types of direct assistance by peacekeeping contingents - e.g. the impact of mission procurement and routine spending by those associated with the mission. Also, the findings with respect to NGO activities suggest that this is an important factor that past case studies and cross-national studies have not taken into account sufficiently.},

abstract = {Informal lenders appear to be thriving even in regions where microfinance institutions (MFIs), such as the Grameen Bank, have established lending programs. We suggest that an explanation for this well-documented observation lies in the ubiquitous use of regularly scheduled repayments by MFIs. Borrowers are typically required to repay their loans in tightly structured installments, beginning soon after loan disbursement. This little- remarked aspect of the repayment schedule is usually explained as inculcating 'fiscal discipline' among borrowers. We argue that an alternative rationale for this loan repayment structure lies in the difficulty of monitoring borrowers' actions. The potential for moral hazard leads MFIs to use innovative mechanisms, such as regularly scheduled repayments, which indirectly coopt the better-informed informal lenders. Conversely, this installment repayment structure allows informal lenders to survive. Further, we show that this linkage can not only expand the volume of informal lending, but may also raise the interest rate in the informal sector. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Donors and the international community have quietly lauded Joaquim Chissano’s recent announcement that he is “not disposed” to seek a third term as president of this former Portuguese colony of 17 million on the southeast coast of Africa. Together with President Frederick Chiluba’s similar announcement in Zambia a few months ago, it looks to many like an indication that these two African democracies are maturing and consolidating the gains that they have made in recent years. Mozambique’s continued place atop the list of the world’s fastestgrowing economies has been seen as another signal that commitment to the “Washington Consensus” will provide the funds required to bring infrastructure, schools, and health care to the rural majority. It is no wonder, then, that Mozambique finds itself highlighted as a success story for the United Nations in conflict-ridden Africa. Many credit Mozambique’s remarkable transformation to the UN’s efforts to sustain the drawn-out peace negotiations, demobilize more than 90,000 soldiers, rebuild a unified national army, and foster the rise of a legitimate, peaceful opposition. Donor investments continue to support Mozambique today, funding more than half of the government’s annual budget.},

This is because they are constructed from enumerations of ethnic groups that include all of the ethnographically distinct groups in a country irrespective of whether or not they engage in the political competition whose effects on macroeconomic policymaking are being tested. I present a new index of ethnic fractionalization based on an accounting of politically relevant ethnic groups in 42 African countries. I employ this measure (called \{PREG\}, for Politically Relevant Ethnic Groups) to replicate Easterly and Levine's influential article on Africa's “growth tragedy.” I find that \{PREG\} does a much better job of accounting for the policy-mediated effects of ethnic diversity on economic growth in Africa than does \{ELF\}.},

Design/methodology/approach – After providing an overview of the research study, the paper locates the research findings in the context of the literature. The discussion explores the research findings in relation to both the paradox of control and the related concept of “seeking serendipity”. Findings – The definition/description of serendipity is examined, the concept of process-perception duality is introduced, and links with the literature are explored. The discussion reassesses the paradox of control in light of the research findings, raising the possibility that information literacy educators have a role to play in developing the perception aspect of serendipity. Practical implications – The paper proposes that, despite the possibly uncomfortable challenges presented by the paradox of control, serendipity deserves more recognition in professional practice. Increased acknowledgement and understanding of serendipity may enable professional practitioners to function more effectively in the unpredictable, dynamic environment that informs the reality of information seeking. Originality/value – The paper adds to the limited existing empirical research investigating serendipity, increasing both academic and practical understanding of the phenomenon. In particular, the introduction of the concept of process-perception duality provides a useful grounding for future research.

abstract = {Following David Lee’s pioneering work, numerous scholars have applied the regression discontinuity (RD) design to popular elections. Contrary to the assumptions of RD, however, we show that bare winners and bare losers in U.S. House elections (1942–2008) differ markedly on pretreatment covariates. Bare winners possess large ex ante financial, experience, and incumbency advantages over their opponents and are usually the candidates predicted to win by Congressional Quarterly’s pre-election ratings. Covariate imbal- ance actually worsens in the closest House elections. National partisan tides help explain these patterns. Previous works have missed this imbalance because they rely excessively on model-based extrapolation. We present evidence suggesting that sorting in close House elections is due mainly to activities on or before Election Day rather than postelection recounts or other manipulation. The sorting is so strong that it is impossible to achieve covariate balance between matched treated and control observations, making covariate adjustment a dubious enterprise. Although RD is problematic for postwar House elections, this example does highlight the design’s advantages over alternatives: RD’s assumptions are clear and weaker than model-based alternatives, and their implications are empirically testable. 1},

In this paper, we use a novel empirical strategy, drawn from research in experimental psychology, to test the linkage between foreign direct investment (FDI) and corruption. The prevailing literature has produced confused and contradictory results on this vital relationship due to errors in their measurement of corruption which are correlated with FDI inflows. When a less biased operationalization is employed, we find clear evidence of corruption during both registration and procurement procedures in Vietnam. The prevalence of corruption, however, is not associated with inflows of FDI. On the contrary, one measure of economic openness appears to be the most important driver of reductions in Vietnamese corruption: the wave of domestic legislation, which accompanied the country's bilateral trade liberalization agreement with the United States (US-BTA), significantly reduced bribery during business registration. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

But we know little about the reasons for variation in the adoption of these technologies across countries. Using cross-national data on government use of information technologies to reform public service delivery, or eGovernment, I argue that politicians' expectations about the effects of more transparent service delivery on established patterns of rent-seeking play an important role in shaping variation in the character of reforms. I show that the level of preexisting corruption in a country is a robust predictor of eGovernment outcomes, with more corrupt governments less likely than their less corrupt peers to implement high-quality public service reforms using information technology. This finding contrasts with those analyses that emphasize the role of economic conditions or regime type in explaining technological diffusion.},

We use data from the auditing of Brazil's local governments to construct objective measures of corruption involving educational block grants transferred from the central government to municipalities. Using variation in the incidence of corruption across municipalities and controlling for student, school, and municipal characteristics, we find a significant negative association between corruption and the school performance of primary school students. Students residing in municipalities where corruption in education was detected score 0.35 standard deviations less on standardized tests, and have significantly higher dropout and failure rates. Using a rich dataset of school infrastructure and teacher and principal questionnaires, we also find that school inputs such as computer labs, teaching supplies, and teacher training are reduced in the presence of corruption. Overall, our findings suggest that in environments where basic schooling resources are lacking, money does matter for student achievement. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

How are these expectations formed? Our view is that humans share a capacity to read one another's intentions through a set of cues such as facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice. The ability to read intentions has evolved along with the mechanisms for displaying intentions. The cues from which intention is inferred come from many sources. People use all of the information available to them in forming expectations about others' play, including information about individual characteristics (such as sex or race) as well as many forms of verbal and nonverbal communications. The most obvious of these is the human face. Two experiments are presented that examined facial expression and perceived trustworthiness. Results show that there can be a mismatch between attitudes and action. In both studies, individuals were adept at assessing the emotional content of the facial expression of an image, and draw inferences about trustworthiness.

abstract = {How do changes in electoral rules affect the nature of public policy outcomes? The current evidence supporting institutional theories that answer this question stems almost entirely from quantitative cross-country studies, the data of which contain very little within-unit variation. Indeed, while there are many country-level accounts of how changes in electoral rules affect such phenomena as the number of parties or voter turnout, there are few studies of how electoral reform affects public policy outcomes. This article contributes to this latter endeavor by providing a detailed analysis of electoral reform and the public policy process in Thailand through an examination of the 1997 electoral reforms. Specifically, the author examines four aspects of policy-making: policy formulation, policy platforms, policy content, and policy outcomes. The article finds that candidates in the pre-1997 era campaigned on broad, generic platforms; parties had no independent means of technical policy expertise; the government targeted health resources to narrow geographic areas; and health was underprovided in Thai society. Conversely, candidates in the post-1997 era relied more on a strong, detailed national health policy; parties created mechanisms to formulate health policy independently; the government allocated health resources broadly to the entire nation through the introduction of a universal health care system, and health outcomes improved. The author attributes these changes in the policy process to the 1997 electoral reform, which increased both constituency breadth (the proportion of the population to which politicians were accountable) and majoritarianism.},

abstract = {In many applications of instrumental-variables regression, researchers seek to defend the plausibility of a key assumption: the instrumental variable is independent of the error term in a linear regression model. Although fulfilling this exogeneity criterion is necessary for a valid application of the instrumental-variables approach, it is not sufficient. In the regression context, the identification of causal effects depends not just on the exogeneity of the in- strument but also on the validity of the underlying model. In this article, I focus on one feature of such models: the assumption that variation in the endogenous regressor that is related to the instrumental variable has the same effect as variation that is unrelated to the instrument. In many applications, this assumption may be quite strong, but relaxing it can limit our ability to estimate parameters of interest. After discussing two substantive exam- ples, I develop analytic results (simulations are reported elsewhere). I also present a spec- ification test that may be useful for determining the relevance of these issues in a given application},

A yearlong field experiment in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) tested the impact of one such media program, a talk show designed to promote listener discussion about intergroup conflict and cooperation. A stratified random half of all nonoverlapping broadcast regions in eastern DRC aired the talk show, which encouraged listeners to consider tolerant opinions and outgroup perspectives, and promoted extended intergroup contact using a related soap opera. The other regions aired the soap opera only. Compared to individuals exposed to the soap opera only, talk show listeners discussed more but were more intolerant, more mindful of grievances, and less likely to aid disliked community members.

In this piece we argue that this is both incongruous with the larger conflict literature and limiting in terms of theoretical impact. Terrorism is more accurately considered a component of conflictual relations between two states generally hostile towards each other, which necessitates an examination of both states. We demonstrate, by conducting a series of negative binomial regression estimates using politically-relevant directed dyads, that interstate rivalries are highly robust, positive predictors of international terrorism. We use two different rivalry measures Klein, Goertz and Diehl (2006) and Rasler and Thompson (2006) and find that interstate rivalries, regardless of operationalization, explain a greater degree of variation in patterns of terrorism than do established significant predictors such as regime type, regime capacity to project force, or population.},

abstract = {This paper explores the conditions under which cultural cleavages become politically salient. It does so by taking advantage of the natural experiment afforded by the division of the Chewa and Tumbuka peoples by the border between Zambia and Malawi. I document that, while the objective cultural differences between Chewas and Tumbukas on both sides of the border are identical, the political salience of the division between these communities is altogether different. I argue that this difference stems from the different sizes of the Chewa and Tumbuka communities in each country relative to each country's national political arena. In Malawi, Chewas and Tumbukas are each large groups vis-\`{a}-vis the country as a whole and, thus, serve as viable bases for political coalition-building. In Zambia, Chewas and Tumbukas are small relative to the country as a whole and, thus, not useful to mobilize as bases of political support. The analysis suggests that the political salience of a cultural cleavage depends not on the nature of the cleavage itself (since it is identical in both countries) but on the sizes of the groups it defines and whether or not they will be useful vehicles for political competition.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to improve our understanding of the role of institutional arrangements and ecological factors that facilitate the emergence and sustainability of successful collective action in small-scale fishing social-ecological systems. Using a modified logistic growth function, we simulate how ecological factors (i.e. carrying capacity) affect small-scale fishing communities with varying degrees of institutional development (i.e. timeliness to adopt new institutions and the degree to which harvesting effort is reduced), in their ability to avoid overexploitation. Our results show that strong and timely institutions are necessary but not sufficient to maintain sustainable harvests over time. The sooner communities adopt institutions, and the stronger the institutions they adopt, the more likely they are to sustain the resource stock. Exactly how timely the institutions must be adopted, and by what amount harvesting effort must be diminished, depends on the ecological carrying capacity of the species at the particular location. Small differences in the carrying capacity between fishing sites, even under scenarios of similar institutional development, greatly affects the likelihood of effective collective action. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To assess fairness, we use the dictator game wherein subjects decide how to allocate a sum of money between themselves and an anonymous counterpart of varying ethnicity. We find that the effects of ethnicity on decision making are captured by our experiments. Although results indicate preferential ingroup treatment, the incidence and magnitude of outgroup bias is much less than expected. We conclude that norms of fairness across ethnicity are remarkably strong in Bosnia, and we take this to be a positive sign for reconciliation after violent conflict.},

We asked local village leaders, provincial governors, national members of parliament, and more than 3,000 Ugandan citizens to demonstrate support for aid. For two aid projects, we randomly assigned exposure to different project funders, including bilateral agencies, multila- teral organizations, and the domestic government. We invited subjects to demon- strate their levels of support or opposition to these projects and donors by voicing their support to others, signing a petition, and sending an SMS. For members of par- liament we asked them to sign letters of support to donors and the national presi- dent. We examine the differences in attitudes and behavioral responses between mass and elite recipients. We generally find that citizens strongly prefer foreign aid over government programs, whereas elites support, albeit more weakly, govern- ment programs over foreign aid in most outcomes. We interpret this as evidence that citizens see aid as an escape from clientelism, but elites may perceive more avenues for the capture of aid resources. 1},

More generally, how do international norms develop in the absence of incentives for cooperation or activism by norm entrepreneurs? Motivated by the case of election observation, I argue that international norms can be generated through a diffusely motivated signaling process. Responding to increased benefits associated with being democratic, international election observation was initiated by democratizing governments as a signal of a government's commitment to democracy. Increased democracy-contingent benefits gave other “true-democrats” the incentive to invite observers, resulting in a widespread belief that all true-democrats invite election monitors. Consequently, not inviting observers became an unambiguous signal that a government was not democratizing, giving even pseudo-democrats reason to invite observers and risk a negative report. I evaluate this theory with an original global dataset on elections and election observation, 1960–2006.},

However, corruption exists, persists, and varies significantly by culture. Lab studies have recently come to the forefront in identifying both the incentives and disincentives for corrupt behavior. However, lab studies on culture and corruption have led to some puzzling, contradictory results. This paper begins with a discussion of non-experimental work in this area, and evaluates the experimental findings in the context of earlier research.The authors sketch out the channels through which culture interacts with corruption (through institutions and social norms), and argue that discrepancies in experimental results may be due to differences in design (including repetition or unobserved variation in beliefs) or to differences in the response to punishment across societies. In addition to exploring design-based reasons for previous contradictory findings, avenues for future research include: behavioral responses to different types of externalities; replicating results in different countries; and utilizing the lab to formulate effective anti-corruption measures},

The coordinating model shows that many voters have incentives to change their votes between the presidential year and midterm after learning the outcome of the presidential election. But this mechanism alone does not explain the size of midterm cycles. The largest source of loss of support for the president's party at midterm is a regular pattern in which the median differences between the voters' ideal points and the parties'policy positions have become less favorable for the president's party than they were at the time of the presidential election (nonvoters show the same pattern).

The underlying incentives stemmed from the candidates search for the personal vote, essential for retaining public office. Differences in the laws regulating the financing of political campaigns explain why excessive bureaucratization in the Italian context also resulted in extensive political corruption},

However, there is broad-based satisfaction with the outcome. Quantitative data from 500 households mirror these findings by showing that, ex-ante, the social fund does not address the expressed needs of the majority of individuals in the majority of communities. By the completion of the project, however, 80 per cent of the community expresses satisfaction with the outcome. An analysis of the determinants of participation reveals that better educated and better networked individuals dominate the process. Propensity-score analysis demonstrates that JSIF has had a causal impact on improvements in trust and the capacity for collective action, but these gains are greater for elites.},

Yet, the presence of an ethnic quota does not imply that political mobilization takes place along ethnic lines: Cross-cutting affiliations within multi-ethnic party organizations may lessen the tendency of politicians to target benefits to particular ethnic groups. In this article, we evaluate the impact of quotas for the presidencies of village councils in India, a subject of considerable recent research. Drawing on fine-grained information from surveys of voters, council members, presidents, and bureaucrats and using a natural experiment to isolate the effects of quotas in the states of Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Bihar, we find weak distributive effects of quotas for marginalized castes and tribes, but suggestive evidence of the importance of partisanship. We then use survey experiments to compare the influence of party and caste on voting preferences and expectations of benefit receipt. Our results suggest that especially when politicians have dynamic political incentives to allocate benefits along party lines, cross-cutting partisan ties can blunt the distributive impact of ethnic quotas.},

abstract = {Persistent, widespread harassment in schools can be understood as a product of collective school norms that deem harassment, and behavior allowing harassment to escalate, as typical and even desirable. Thus, one approach to reducing harassment is to change students' perceptions of these collective norms. Theory suggests that the public behavior of highly connected and chronically salient actors in a group, called social referents, may provide influential cues for individuals' perception of collective norms. Using repeated, complete social network surveys of a public high school, we demonstrate that changing the public behavior of a randomly assigned subset of student social referents changes their peers' perceptions of school collective norms and their harassment behavior. Social referents exert their influence over peers' perceptions of collective norms through the mechanism of everyday social interaction, particularly interaction that is frequent and personally motivated, in contrast to interaction shaped by institutional channels like shared classes. These findings clarify the development of collective social norms: They depend on certain patterns of and motivations for social interactions within groups across time, and are not static but constantly reshaped and reproduced through these interactions. Understanding this process creates opportunities for changing collective norms and behavior.},

abstract = {Community-based and -driven development projects have become an important form of development assistance, with the World Bank's portfolio alone approximating \$7 billion. A review of their conceptual foundations and evidence on their effectiveness shows that projects that rely on community participation have not been particularly effective at targeting the poor. There is some evidence that such projects create effective community infrastructure, but not a single study establishes a causal relationship between any outcome and participatory elements of a community-based development project. Most such projects are dominated by elites, and both targeting and project quality tend to be markedly worse in more unequal communities. A distinction between potentially "benevolent" forms of elite domination and more pernicious types of capture is likely to be important for understanding project dynamics and outcomes. Several qualitative studies indicate that the sustainability of community-based initiatives depends crucially on an enabling institutional environment, which requires government commitment, and on accountability of leaders to their community to avoid "supply-driven demand-driven" development. External agents strongly influence project success, but facilitators are often poorly trained, particularly in rapidly scaled-up programs. The naive application of complex contextual concepts like participation, social capital, and empowerment is endemic among project implementers and contributes to poor design and implementation. The evidence suggests that community-based and -driven development projects are best undertaken in a context-specific manner, with a long time horizon and with careful and well-designed monitoring and evaluation systems.},

The right of noncabinetmembers to propose legislation is assigned by lottery. Comparing outcomes between thosewhowere granted the right to propose and thosewho were not, we show that incumbents of the governing party enjoy a 2.7 percentage point bonus in vote total in the election following their winning the right to introduce a single piece of legislation, which translates to a 7\% increase in the probability of winning. The causal effect results from higher likeability among constituents. These results demonstrate experimentally that what politicians do as lawmakers has a causal effect on electoral outcomes.},

This paper provides the first large-N empirical evidence on the credibility of voice in a deliberative democracy in an non-laboratory setting, using a unique dataset collected from transcripts of deliberation that occurred between January and September 2003 in 127 functioning village parliaments (gram sabhas) in Southern India. We exploit a natural experiment in the arrangement of India's state borders across ethnolinguistic lines that led exogenously to increased caste fragmentation and a reduced degree of consensus on public goods priorities. We then examine the patterns of deliberation. We reject the presence of pure cheap talk in both heterogeneous and homogeneous villages. Instead, we show that in caste-fragmented South Indian villages, where there is less village-wide agreement on the relative importance of different public goods, the probability of an individual's highest priority being discussed increases as the household becomes more credible: its preferences approach the pivotal agent in a pure representative democracy, the median household. These effects are lower in ethnically homogeneous villages where there is greater consensus on the prioritization of public goods. Taken together, our results suggest that India's village parliaments, rather than being mere talking shops or being entirely captured by elites, seem instead to be both democratically representative and to be assigning roles to credible agents in their deliberative processes. ?? 2012.},

First, we can ameliorate the e ects of dicult-to-measure outcomes by including qualitative information on outcomes within matched sets, sometimes reducing p -values. Second, additional information across matched sets enables the construction of qualitative con dence in- tervals on e ect size. Third, qualitative information on unmeasured confounders within matched sets reduces the conservativeness of Rosenbaum-style sensitivity analysis. This approach accom- modates small to medium sample sizes in a nonparametric framework, and therefore may be particularly useful for analyses of the e ects of institutions in a given set of units.

Yet eliciting truthful answers in surveys is challenging, especially when studying sensitive issues such as racial prejudice, corruption, and support for militant groups. List experiments have attracted much attention recently as a potential solution to this measurement problem. Many researchers, however, have used a simple difference-in-means estimator, which prevents the efficient examination of multivariate relationships between respondents’ characteristics and their responses to sensitive items. Moreover, no systematic means exists to investigate the role of underlying assumptions. We fill these gaps by developing a set of new statistical methods for list experiments. We identify the commonly invoked assumptions, propose new multivariate regression estimators, and develop methods to detect and adjust for potential violations of key assumptions. For empirical illustration, we analyze list experiments concerning racial prejudice. Open-source software is made available to implement the proposed methodology.},

We offer two analytic results that have important implications for the relative merits of observational and experimental inquiry. The first result addresses the optimal weight that should be assigned to unbiased experimental research and potentially biased observational research. We find that unless researchers have prior information about the biases associated with observational research, observational findings are accorded zero weight regardless of sample size, and researchers learn about causality exclusively through experimental results. The second result describes the optimal allocation of future resources to observational and experimental research, given different marginal costs for each type of data collection and a budget constraint. Under certain conditions (e.g., severe budget constraints and prohibitive costs of experimental data), it is optimal to allocate one’s entire budget to observational data. However, so long as one harbors some uncertainty about the biases of observational research, even an infinite supply of observational data cannot provide exact estimates of causal parameters. In the absence of theoretical or methodological breakthroughs, the only possibility for further learning comes from experiments, particularly experiments with strong external validity.},

Small-n analyses using this method should therefore, at a minimum, clearly define the dependent, independent, and control variables so they may be measured for additional units, and specify how the control variables are weighted in defining similarity between units.

In this article, I propose new nonlinear least squares and maximum likelihood estimators for efficient multivariate regression analysis with the item count technique. The two-step estimation procedure and the Expectation Maximization algorithm are developed to facilitate the computation. Enabling multivariate regression analysis is essential because researchers are typically interested in knowing how the probability of answering the sensitive question affirmatively varies as a function of respondents? characteristics. As an empirical illustration, the proposed methodology is applied to the 1991 National Race and Politics survey where the investigators used the item count technique to measure the degree of racial hatred in the United States. Small-scale simulation studies suggest that the maximum likelihood estimator can be substantially more efficient than alternative estimators.

Much of this work has extended and brought a renewed focus on old approaches such as matching, which is the focus of this review. The new developments highlight an old tension in the social sciences: a focus on research design versus a focus on quantitative models. This realization, along with the renewed interest in field experiments, has marked the return of foun- dational questions as opposed to a fascination with the latest estimator. I use studies of get-out-the-vote interventions to exemplify this devel- opment.

abstract = {In many applications of instrumental-variables regression, researchers seek to defend the plausibility of a key assumption: the instrumental variable is independent of the error term in a linear regression model. Although fulfilling this exogeneity criterion is necessary for a valid application of the instrumental-variables approach, it is not sufficient. In the regression context, the identification of causal effects depends not just on the exogeneity of the in- strument but also on the validity of the underlying model. In this article, I focus on one feature of such models: the assumption that variation in the endogenous regressor that is related to the instrumental variable has the same effect as variation that is unrelated to the instrument. In many applications, this assumption may be quite strong, but relaxing it can limit our ability to estimate parameters of interest. After discussing two substantive exam- ples, I develop analytic results (simulations are reported elsewhere). I also present a spec- ification test that may be useful for determining the relevance of these issues in a given application},

I find that compared to appointed leaders, directly elected leaders are sig- nificantly more responsive to group members, leading to higher levels of cooperation. Analyzing possible mechanisms, I find that community organizations using appoint- ments are less likely to develop monitoring institutions and auditing practices that are vital for constraining the behavior of local elites. Unique social network data provides evidence that close friendship ties between appointed and appointees substitute for formal monitoring institutions, leading to loss of confidence by community members and, subsequently, to a decline in public goods contributions.},

abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

They do so to their detriment because heeding the basic lessons of statistical inference can prevent serious inferential errors. Of particular importance is the use of conditional probabilities to compare relevant counterfactuals. A prominent example of work using Mill\&apos;s methods is Theda Skocpol\&apos;s States and Social Revolutions. Barbara Geddes\&apos;s widely assigned critique of Skocpol\&apos;s claim of a causal relationship between foreign threat and social revolution is valid if this relationship is considered to be deterministic. If, however, we interpret Skocpol\&apos;s hypothesized causal relationship to be probabilistic, Geddes\&apos;s data support Skocpol\&apos;s hypothesis. But Skocpol, unlike Geddes, failed to provide the data necessary to compare conditional probabilities. Also problematic for Skocpol is the fact that when one makes causal inferences, conditional probabilities are of interest only insofar as they provide information about relevant counterfactuals.Jasjeet S.

Although field experimentation is often considered a quantitative enterprise, this paper illustrates the compatibility of field experimentation with various types of qualitative measurement tools and research questions. Integrating qualitative and quantitative data within field experiments allows investigators to move past simple average treatment effects and explore mechanisms of the identified causal effect. A more novel proposal is to use field experimentation as the organizing methodological framework for archival, ethnographic, or interpretive work, and to use ethnographic methods as the primary source of measurement in “experimental ethnography.” Sustained research and theoretical specificity can address some of the seemingly incompatible features of qualitative and field experimental methods. For example, small sample sizes are acceptable as part of a research program, and some theories of historical patterns or rare events could be disaggregated into smaller cause and effect linkages to test with field experiments in theoretically relevant contexts.},

abstract = {Valid causal inference is central to progress in theoretical and applied psychology. Although the randomized experiment is widely considered the gold standard for determining whether a given exposure increases the likelihood of some specified outcome, experiments are not always feasible and in some cases can result in biased estimates of causal effects. Alternatively, standard observational approaches are limited by the possibility of confounding, reverse causation, and the nonrandom distribution of exposure (i.e., selection). We describe the counterfactual model of causation and apply it to the challenges of causal inference in observational research, with a particular focus on aging. We argue that the study of twin pairs discordant on exposure, and in particular discordant monozygotic twins, provides a useful analog to the idealized counterfactual design. A review of discordant-twin studies in aging reveals that they are consistent with, but do not unambiguously establish, a causal effect of lifestyle factors on important late-life outcomes. Nonetheless, the existing studies are few in number and have clear limitations that have not always been considered in interpreting their results. It is concluded that twin researchers could make greater use of the discordant-twin design as one approach to strengthen causal inferences in observational research.},

To take advantage of the rich background data that researchers often have (but underutilize) in these experiments, we develop methods that use continuous covariates to assign treatments sequentially. We build on biased coin and minimization procedures for discrete covariates and demonstrate that our methods outperform complete randomization, producing better covariate balance in simulated data. We then describe how we selected and deployed a sequential blocking method in a clinical trial and demonstrate the advantages of our having done so. Further, we show how that method would have performed in two larger sequential political trials.

We develop a new sensitivity analysis for examining the robustness of empirical findings to the potential violation of a key identification assumption. We apply the proposed methods to three political psychology experiments, which examine alternative causal pathways between media framing and public opinion.

abstract = {Recently there has been a surge in econometric work focusing on estimating average treatment effects under various sets of assumptions. One strand of this literature has developed methods for estimating average treatment effects for a binary treatment under assumptions variously described as exogeneity, unconfoundedness, or selection on observables. The implication of these assumptions is that systematic (for example, average or distributional) differences in outcomes between treated and control units with the same values for the covariates are attributable to the treatment. Recent analysis has considered estimation and inference for average treatment effects under weaker assumptions than typical of the earlier literature by avoiding distributional and functional-form assumptions. Various methods of semiparametric estimation have been proposed, including estimating the unknown regression functions, matching, methods using the propensity score such as weighting and blocking, and combinations of these approaches. In this paper I review the state of this literature and discuss some of its unanswered questions, focusing in particular on the practical implementation of these methods, the plausibility of this exogeneity assumption in economic applications, the relative performance of the various semiparametric estimators when the key assumptions (unconfoundedness and overlap) are satisfied, alternative estimands such as quantile treatment effects, and alternate methods such as Bayesian inference.},

Insights from psychological science can make these calls dramatically more potent while also generating opportunities to expand psychological theory. We present a field experiment conducted during the 2008 presidential election (N = 287,228) showing that facilitating the formation of a voting plan (i.e., implementation intentions) can increase turnout by 4.1 percentage points among those contacted, but a standard encouragement call and self-prediction have no significant impact. Among single-eligible-voter households, the formation of a voting plan increased turnout among persons contacted by 9.1 percentage points, whereas those in multiple-eligible-voter households were unaffected by all scripts. Some situational factors may organically facilitate implementation-intentions formation more readily than others; we present data suggesting that this could explain the differential treatment effect that we found. We discuss implications for psychological and political science, and public interventions involving implementation-intentions formation.},

Many of these books fail to keep in mind that the behavior of elites—the well-educated and politically active individuals who often represent the peer group of these authors—is not generally representative of the behavior of the public at large. Pundits and scholars alike have remarked that 2008 appeared to be a revolutionary year in the use of the Internet in political campaigns, but few have systematically examined the role of the Internet in participatory politics for the average voter. Instead of relying on case studies, this article uses nationally representative survey data from 2004 through 2008 to determine how the general public uses—or does not use—the Internet in their political lives. The authors then consider whether the patterns of use for this technology appear different in the November 2008 general election cycle. They consider this issue in the context of increasing polarization among some fraction of the American electorate and in the policy platforms of elected officials.},

Bush is president because he overcame his election day deficit with overseas absentee ballots that arrived and were counted after election day. In the final official tally, Bush received 537 more votes than Gore. These numbers are taken from the official results released by the Florida Secretary of State’s office and so do not reflect overvotes, undervotes, unsuccessful litigation, butterfly ballot problems, recounts that might have been allowed but were not, or any other hypothetical divergence between voter preferences and counted votes. After the election, the New York Times conducted a six month long investigation and found that 680 of the overseas absentee ballots were illegally counted, and no partisan, pundit, or academic has publicly disagreed with their assessment. In this paper, we describe the statistical procedures we developed and implemented for the Times to ascertain whether disqualifying these 680 ballots would have changed the outcome of the election. The methods involve adding formal Bayesian model averaging procedures to King’s (1997) ecological inference model. Formal Bayesian model averaging has not been used in political science but is especially useful when substantive conclusions depend heavily on apparently minor but indefensible model choices, when model generalization is not feasible, and when potential critics are more partisan than academic. We show how we derived the results for the Times so that other scholars can use these methods to make ecological inferences for other purposes. We also present a variety of new empirical results that delineate the precise conditions under which Al Gore would have been elected president, and offer new evidence of the striking effectiveness of the Republican effort to convince local election officials to count invalid ballots in Bush counties and not count them in Gore counties.</p>},

If we control for respondents’ perception of the closeness of the race in their riding, whether they were contacted during the campaign and whether they identify with a political party, the age gap decreases by a further three points — a reduction of 43\% in the original gap. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that cynicism and negative attitudes toward politics and politicians are poor explanations for the discrepancy in turnout between young and old. Finally, if we include political information and interest in the model, there is no statistically significant difference in turnout between young and old citizens.Acta Politica (2004) 39, 407–421. doi:10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500079},

abstract = {Statistical analysis requires a probability model: commonly, a model for the dependence of outcomes Y on confounders X and a potentially causal variable Z. When the goal of the analysis is to infer Z's effects on Y , this requirement introduces an element of circularity: in order to decide how Z affects Y , the analyst first determines, speculatively, the manner of Y 's dependence on Z and other variables. This paper takes a statistical perspective that avoids such circles, permitting analysis of Z's effects on Y even as the statistician remains entirely agnostic about the conditional distribution of Y given X and Z, or perhaps even denies that such a distribution exists. Our assumptions instead pertain to the conditional distribution Z|X, and the role of speculation in settling them is reduced by the use of such techniques as propensity scores, poststratification, testing for overt bias before accepting a poststratification, and optimal full matching. Such beginnings pave the way for ``randomization inference'', an approach which, despite a long history in the analysis of designed experiments, is relatively new to political science and to other fields in which experimental data are rarely available. The approach applies to both experiments and observational studies. We illustrate this by applying it to analyze A. Gerber and D. Green's New Haven Vote 98 campaign. Conceived as both a get-out-the-vote campaign and a field experiment in political participation, the campaign as it turned out was in some ways more similar to an observational study than to a randomized experiment. Our analysis uses the strengths of the design of their study while adjusting for irregularities ignored by the original analysis. We estimate the number of voters who would not have voted had the campaign not prompted them to --- that is, the total number of votes attributable to the interventions of the campaigners. Both our statistical inferences about these attributable effects and the stratification and matching that precede them rely on quite recent developments from statistics; our matching, in particular, has novel features of potentially wide applicability. Our broad findings resemble those of the original analysis by Gerber and Green (2000), although in the small, the method offers additional information as to the campaign's effects upon interestingly different subgroups, such as older voters or those who have not voted in a previous election. },

Plebiscites resulted in dramatically higher satisfaction among villagers, increased knowledge about the project, greater perceived benefits, and higher reported willingness to contribute. Changing the political mechanism had much smaller effects on the actual projects selected, with some evidence that plebiscites resulted in projects chosen by women being located in poorer areas. The results suggest that direct participation in political decision making can substantially increase satisfaction and legitimacy.},

While personalized tactics are efficient with regards to cost, coordinating large-scale door-to-door canvassing operations for state-wide offices is a daunting task. Given the hundreds of thousands of voters to be contacted, reaching every targeted person in the last days leading up to Election Day may prove logistically difficult. Expanding the days on which Get Out the Vote (GOTV) activities take place would make conducting labor intensive canvassing campaigns much easier to administer. However, there has been very little attention paid to the timing of campaign outreach and when it is maximally effective. This paper addresses this lacuna by analyzing a door-to-door voter mobilization experiment that randomly varied the timing of campaign outreach.},

This paper argues that such grants-financed decentralization enables politicians to target benefits to pivotal voters and organized interest groups in exchange for political support. Decentralization, in this model, is subject to political capture, facilitating vote-buying, patronage, or pork-barrel projects, at the expense of effective provision of broad public goods. There is anecdotal evidence on local politics in several large countries that is consistent with this theory.

Both proponents and opponents of electoral reforms agree that these reforms should increase the demographic representativeness of the electorate by reducing the direct costs of voting, thereby increasing turnout among less-privileged groups who, presumably, aremost sensitive to the costs of coming to the polls. In fact, these reforms have been greatly contested because both major political parties believe that increasing turnout among less-privileged groups will benefit Democratic politicians. I review evidence from numerous studies of electoral reform to demonstrate that reforms designed to make it easier for registered voters to cast their ballots actually increase, rather than reduce, socioeconomic biases in the composition of the voting public. I conclude with a recommendation that we shift the focus of electoral reform from an emphasis on institutional changes to a concentration on political engagement.},

Combining "lab-in-the-field" experiments with observational data on 1,541 Ugandan farmers from 50 communities, we demonstrate the positive effect of internal centralized sanctioning authorities on cooperative behavior. We also show that the size of this effect depends on the political process by which authority is granted: subjects electing leaders contribute more to public goods than subjects who were assigned leaders through a lottery. To test the ecological validity of our findings, we relate farmers' behavior in the experiment to their level of cooperation in their community organization. We show that deference to authority in the controlled setting predicts cooperative behavior in the farmers' natural environment, in which they face a similar social dilemma.},

abstract = {Vote-buying has and continues to be pervasive in many electoral regimes. Yet the relationship between vote-buying and citizen behavior, particularly in the context of the secret ballot, remains largely unknown. In this paper I study vote-buying’s effect on voter turnout in Kenya, using a nationally representative survey that includes questions about the country's 2002 presidential and parliamentary elections. Estimating the causal effect of vote-buying on voter turnout is complicated by the strategic nature of vote-buying, and so this study also examines the strategic logic of vote-buying in Kenya. The results suggest that poor individuals and “swing” voters in the country's most electorally competitive districts are most likely to be targeted by vote-buyers. Using these results, I use probit statistical models as well as propensity score matching and estimate that individuals who were approached by a vote-buyer were about 14 percentage points more likely to vote than those who were not, while the least educated individuals were the most highly influenced by vote-buying. These results are puzzling. If voting is secret and voluntary, why does vote-buying have an impact on individual behavior? I propose and test the empirical implications of two potential explanations: a monitoring and punishment mechanism, and a credibility signaling mechanism. The evidence is tentatively consistent with the monitoring and punishment mechanism, and is also consistent with the credibility signaling mechanism. I conclude with discussion of the study's implications for theories of vote-buying and for the quality of democracy and political accountability in settings where vote-buying is commonplace.},

Utilizing data from the power corporation of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, we study the politics of electricity losses. Examining annual data over four decades, we document that UP's electricity losses tend to increase in periods immediately prior to state assembly elections. Drawing upon geographically disaggregated data for the period 2000-09, we observe higher line losses just prior to the 2002 and 2007 state elections. Our analysis shows that the incumbent party was more likely to retain the assembly seat as line losses in the locality increased. We interpret these results as corroboration that political parties deliberately redirect electricity to flat rate and unbilled users in a context of chronically inadequate supply. Political factors appear to affect line losses in ways that technical and economic factors alone cannot explain. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Whereas previous studies have shown that closed-list proportional representation is associated with greater (perceived) corruption than open-list PR, it is demonstrated here that this relationship fails to hold once district magnitude is considered. The theory underlying this study draws on work on \&lsquo;the personal vote\&rsquo; that suggests that the incentives to amass resources \&ndash; and perhaps even to do so illegally \&ndash; increase with district magnitude in open-list settings but decrease in closed-list contexts. Extending this insight, it is shown that political corruption gets more (less) severe as district magnitude increases under open-list PR (closed-list PR) systems. In addition, once district magnitude exceeds a certain threshold \&ndash; the estimates here are that this is as low as fifteen \&ndash; corruption is greater under open lists than closed lists. Only at small district magnitudes (below fifteen) is closed-list PR associated with more corruption, as conventionally held. These results hold for alternative measures of corruption, for different sets of countries analysed, for different measures of district magnitude and regardless of whether the political system is presidential or parliamentary, and of the number of parties.Using an objective measure of corruption in public works contracting, corroborating evidence is also presented from Italian electoral districts. In Italy\&apos;s open-list environment in the period prior to 1994, larger districts were more susceptible to corruption than smaller ones.},

African rulers, whether self-appointed or democratically elected, rely on the distribution of personal favors to selected members of the elec- torate in exchange for ongoing political support. 1 This observation re- lies on the implicit assumption that African voters invariably have a much stronger preference for private transfers than for public goods or projects of national interest.

This article incorporates citizen-candidate social identities into game-theoretic models of electoral competition under plurality and majority-runoff electoral rules, indicating that social group demographics can affect the equilibrium number of candidates, even in non-permissive systems. Under plurality rule, the relationship between social homogeneity and the effective number of candidates is non-monotonic and, contrary to the prevailing Duvergerian intuition, for some demographic configurations even the effective number of candidates cannot be near two. Empirical patterns in cross-national presidential election results are consistent with the theoretical model.},

The findings suggest incumbent campaigns failed to increase incumbent vote share, whereas the challenger campaign was effective. To understand these and other results, the incumbent's optimal spending strategy was analyzed theoretically. The analysis reveals that if incumbents maximize their probability of victory rather than vote share, campaigns by typical incumbents are expected to produce only minimal improvement in incumbent vote share. The analysis also explains how returns to campaign spending vary with the competitiveness of the election, how incumbent spending can improve the incumbent's probability of victory yet have only minimal effect on incumbent vote share, and why rational spending plans might decrease the sponsor's expected vote. This article demonstrates the wide scope of application for field experiments and provides an example of how experimental findings can serve as a catalyst for generating theories.},

We provide a data set of all national elections between 1945 and 2006 and a measure of whether each election event is structured such that the competition is possible. We outline the pitfalls of other measures used by scholars to define the potential for electoral competition and show that such methods can lead to biased or incomplete findings. The new global data on elections and the minimal conditions necessary for electoral competition are introduced, followed by an empirical illustration of the differences between the proposed measure of competition and existing methods used to infer the existence of competition.},

But many goods that politicians deliver to voters are locally nonexcludable in rural areas, so the local presence of an ethnic group associated with a politician should affect a rural voter's assessment of how likely she is to benefit from that politician's election. Using geocoded polling-station–level election results alongside survey data from Ghana, we show that otherwise similar voters are less likely to vote for the party of their own ethnic group, and more likely to support a party associated with another group, when the local ethnic geography favors the other group. This result helps account for the imperfect correlation between ethnicity and vote choice in African democracies. More generally, this demonstrates how local community and geographic contexts can modify the information conveyed by ethnicity and influence voter behavior.},

A fully randomized field experiment with over 100,000 subjects comparing professional and volunteer phone banks simultaneously was conducted during the 2002 congressional elections to test this hypothesis. The experiment discovers precisely the opposite relationship of prior research: effective professional phone banks and inefficient volunteer phone calls. The experiment also finds substantial temporal decay. The specific messages appear less important than tone or timing. The implications for the role of campaign consultants, replacing social capital, voter psychology, and the capacities of civic organizations are discussed.},

To address this challenge, we have designed and conducted a randomized experiment during the presidential elections of July 2006 in Sao Tome and Principe. This is a newly found oil-rich West African country that has been facing an increase in ‘retail’ vote buying. Our research design included a randomized campaign against vote buying sponsored by the Electoral Commission of the country, and pre-electoral campaign/post-election panel surveys in treatment (exposed to the campaign) and control locations, including 1034 subjects across 50 different areas. We observe a significant effect of the campaign on perceptions of vote buying, which constitutes the exogenous variation we use to identify effects on voting behavior. We characterize determinants of vote buying (more frequent in swing and rural locations), and find that vote buying energizes the electorate by increasing turnout. Crucially, we capture real effects on candidates’ relative performance, by identifying the challenger to be driving more votes through vote buying (after the treatment), which is consistent with the timeline of events (late challenger candidacy). This result controls for changes in information about the candidates (e.g. policy platforms) and location-specific minutes spent by international electoral observers.},

Our three-parameter model reconciles prior inconsistent empirical results and argues that low-propensity voters can be effectively mobilized only in high-turnout elections. The model is tested on 11 randomized face-to-face votermobilization field experiments in which we specifically analyze whether subjects’ baseline propensity to vote conditions the effectiveness of door-to-door GOTV canvassing.

Citizens in advanced democracies are able to accomplish something that citizens in fledgling democracies are not: inattentive and poorly informed citizens are able to vote like their better informed compatriots and hence need to pay little attention to political events such as election campaigns in order to vote as if they were attentive.

Psychological research on descriptive social norms suggests that emphasizing the opposite—that many do vote—would be a more effective message. In two get-out-the-vote field experiments, we find that messages emphasizing low expected turnout are less effective at motivating voters than messages emphasizing high expected turnout. The findings suggest that descriptive social norms affect vote intention only among citizens who vote infrequently or occasionally. Practically, the results suggest that voter mobilization efforts should emphasize high turnout, especially when targeting occasional and low rate of participation voters. More generally, our findings suggest that the common lamentation by the media and politicians regarding low participation may undermine turnout.},

We address these questions by studying observers’ effects on two markers of fraud — overvoting (more votes cast than registered voters) and unnaturally high levels of turnout — during Ghana’s 2012 presidential elections. Our randomized saturation experimental design allows us to estimate observers’ causal effects and to identify how political parties strategically respond to observers. We show that observers signif- icantly reduce overvoting and suspicious turnout at polling stations to which they are deployed. We also find that political parties successfully relocate fraud from observed to unobserved stations in their historical strongholds, where they enjoy social penetration and political competition is low, whereas they are not able to do so in politically competitive constituencies. The findings have implications for understanding political party behavior and the effects of governance interventions},

abstract = {How do changes in electoral rules affect the nature of public policy outcomes? The current evidence supporting institutional theories that answer this question stems almost entirely from quantitative cross-country studies, the data of which contain very little within-unit variation. Indeed, while there are many country-level accounts of how changes in electoral rules affect such phenomena as the number of parties or voter turnout, there are few studies of how electoral reform affects public policy outcomes. This article contributes to this latter endeavor by providing a detailed analysis of electoral reform and the public policy process in Thailand through an examination of the 1997 electoral reforms. Specifically, the author examines four aspects of policy-making: policy formulation, policy platforms, policy content, and policy outcomes. The article finds that candidates in the pre-1997 era campaigned on broad, generic platforms; parties had no independent means of technical policy expertise; the government targeted health resources to narrow geographic areas; and health was underprovided in Thai society. Conversely, candidates in the post-1997 era relied more on a strong, detailed national health policy; parties created mechanisms to formulate health policy independently; the government allocated health resources broadly to the entire nation through the introduction of a universal health care system, and health outcomes improved. The author attributes these changes in the policy process to the 1997 electoral reform, which increased both constituency breadth (the proportion of the population to which politicians were accountable) and majoritarianism.},

This paper argues this trend demonstrates that voters are beginning to poll "correctly" - that is, to ascertain their most-preferred candidate. This convergence process is consistent with boundedly rational voters making decisions with low information. We examine the process by which voters can use opinion polls to guide their candidate choice. We undertake a series of laboratory experiments where uninformed voters choose between two candidates after participating in a series of pre-election polls. We demonstrate that voters update their beliefs about candidate locations using information contained in the opinion polls. We compare two behavioral models for the updating process and find significant evidence to support a boundedly rational Bayesian updating assumption. This assumption about the updating process is key to many theoretical results which argue that voters have the potential to aggregate information via a coordination signal and for their beliefs to converge to the true state of the world. This finding also indicates that uninformed voters are able to use pre-election polls to help them make correct decisions. ?? 2011.},

More generally, how do international norms develop in the absence of incentives for cooperation or activism by norm entrepreneurs? Motivated by the case of election observation, I argue that international norms can be generated through a diffusely motivated signaling process. Responding to increased benefits associated with being democratic, international election observation was initiated by democratizing governments as a signal of a government's commitment to democracy. Increased democracy-contingent benefits gave other “true-democrats” the incentive to invite observers, resulting in a widespread belief that all true-democrats invite election monitors. Consequently, not inviting observers became an unambiguous signal that a government was not democratizing, giving even pseudo-democrats reason to invite observers and risk a negative report. I evaluate this theory with an original global dataset on elections and election observation, 1960–2006.},

abstract = {Vote buying has and continues to be pervasive in many electoral regimes. Yet the relationship between vote buying and voting behavior, particularly in the context of the secret ballot, remains largely unknown. In this paper I study the effect of vote buying on voter turnout in Kenya, using a nationally representative survey that includes questions about the country's 2002 presidential and parliamentary elections. Estimating the causal effect of vote buying on voter turnout is complicated by its strategic nature, and so this study also examines the strategic logic of vote buying in Kenya. The results suggest that poor individuals and “swing” voters in the country's most electorally competitive districts are vote buyers most likely targets. Using these results, I use matching to estimate that individuals who were approached by a vote buyer were about 14 percentage points more likely to vote than those who were not, while the least educated individuals were the most highly influenced by vote-buying. These results present a puzzle. If voting is secret and voluntary, why does vote buying have this impact? I propose and test the empirical implications of three explanations: individual monitoring, community-level monitoring, and credibility signaling. Evidence is consistent with individual monitoring and credibility signaling, though not with community-level monitoring: vote buying influences perceptions of party monitoring and involvement in violence, and improves perceptions of party credibility.},

We also show that the size of this effect depends on the political process by which authority is granted: subjects electing leaders contribute more to public goods than subjects who were assigned leaders through a lottery. To test the ecological validity of our findings, we relate farmers' behavior in the experiment to their level of cooperation in their community organization. We show that deference to authority in the controlled setting predicts cooperative behavior in the farmers' natural environment, in which they face a similar social dilemma.},

abstract = {Following David Lee’s pioneering work, numerous scholars have applied the regression discontinuity (RD) design to popular elections. Contrary to the assumptions of RD, however, we show that bare winners and bare losers in U.S. House elections (1942–2008) differ markedly on pretreatment covariates. Bare winners possess large ex ante financial, experience, and incumbency advantages over their opponents and are usually the candidates predicted to win by Congressional Quarterly’s pre-election ratings. Covariate imbal- ance actually worsens in the closest House elections. National partisan tides help explain these patterns. Previous works have missed this imbalance because they rely excessively on model-based extrapolation. We present evidence suggesting that sorting in close House elections is due mainly to activities on or before Election Day rather than postelection recounts or other manipulation. The sorting is so strong that it is impossible to achieve covariate balance between matched treated and control observations, making covariate adjustment a dubious enterprise. Although RD is problematic for postwar House elections, this example does highlight the design’s advantages over alternatives: RD’s assumptions are clear and weaker than model-based alternatives, and their implications are empirically testable. 1},

Furthermore, those types of voters who would be most likely to receive ethnic patronage are those who are most likely to vote ethnically.

Individuals who were able to vote in elections at all three levels of government (national, state, and local) in 2002 were surveyed, allowing a full test of the federalist voting model.

We find that the bulk of the persuasive impact of advertising decays quickly, but that some effect in the presidential campaign endures for at least 6 weeks. These results, which are similar in rolling cross-section survey data and county-level data on actual presidential vote, appear to reflect amix of memory-based processing (whose effects last only as long as short-term memory lasts) and online processing (whose effects are more durable). Finally, we find that immediate effects of advertising are larger in subnational than presidential elections, but decay more quickly and more completely.},

We then consider the relationship between various factors and the decision to vote among Canadian youth. Following this, we perform a cohort analysis to show how youth electoral participation has evolved over time. In these analyses, we distinguish two youth groups, those aged 18–24 and those 25–30, whom we compare to all other age groups. We finally examine the factors that seem to affect Canadian youths’ decision to vote or not to vote. We briefly summarize existing research in the area, particularly in Canada but also abroad, with a view to establishing the state of knowledge, the major gaps that exist and the most promising avenues for further research. We find that Canadian youth are different from their older counterparts. They are less likely to be married, somewhat better educated and slightly less religious. They earn less income. But they are more likely to have been born in Canada. Of these socio-demographic factors, education and origin (i.e. being born in Canada) are the most powerful predictors of voting. But the most crucial determinants are interest in politics and information about politics. Our cohort analysis suggests that most of the decline in voter turnout is attributable to decline among younger generations. After reviewing the current knowledge on the causes of declining youth turnout, we suggest future studies that could identify solutions to address this decline.},

abstract = {Prior research demonstrates that many citizens are unable to perceive differences between the two major political parties. In order to investigate whether candidate behavior in campaigns contributes to this perception, we test implications about partisan constraints on campaign rhetoric drawn from the literature on parties and policy convergence. Our results suggest that candidates of different parties do not highlight the same issues or positions in their campaign advertising. We find that campaign rhetoric is strongly motivated by party even when controlling for constituency characteristics and other factors. Thus, there is convergence among candidates of the same party across districts and states and divergence between opposing candidates within districts and states. Our results are based on a detailed content analysis of more than 1,000 campaign advertisements aired by 290 candidates in 153 elections in 37 states during the 1998 midterm elections.},

The potential implications are problematic: Ideological camps on the left and right of the political spectrum, with different understandings of politics due to these fundamentally distinct sources of information. We develop a model of media effects given selective exposure and ask whether opinionated political shows polarize viewers. We test our hypotheses using a novel experimental design that requires participants to watch pro-attitudinal and counter-?‐ attitudinal programs in some treatment conditions, but allows others limited choice over what they watch. We find that the polarizing effects of political programs on cable networks dissipate when people can choose across these options or watch entertainment programs. While enabling people to construct an ideologically congruent information environment, media fragmentation also allows those most susceptible to media influence to select out of political information altogether.},

Contrary to conventional wisdom, East Germans exposed to West German television were more satisfied with life in East Germany and more supportive of the East German regime. To explain this surprising finding, we show that East Germans used West German television primarily as a source of entertainment.

Many of these books fail to keep in mind that the behavior of elites—the well-educated and politically active individuals who often represent the peer group of these authors—is not generally representative of the behavior of the public at large. Pundits and scholars alike have remarked that 2008 appeared to be a revolutionary year in the use of the Internet in political campaigns, but few have systematically examined the role of the Internet in participatory politics for the average voter. Instead of relying on case studies, this article uses nationally representative survey data from 2004 through 2008 to determine how the general public uses—or does not use—the Internet in their political lives. The authors then consider whether the patterns of use for this technology appear different in the November 2008 general election cycle. They consider this issue in the context of increasing polarization among some fraction of the American electorate and in the policy platforms of elected officials.},

Much as other technologies, the Internet has diffused unevenly across countries, raising concerns over a "digital divide." My main proposition is that its spread has been driven by neither technological nor economic factors alone. Rather, political factors exert a powerful influence. Groups that believe they will lose from the Internet use political institutions to enact policies that block the spread of the Internet. Some political institutions make this easier than others. Data from roughly 190 countries from 1991 to 2001 showthat a country's regime type matters greatly, even when controlling for other economic, technological, political, and sociological factors. Democratic governments facilitate the spread of the Internet relative to autocratic ones. Thus, the spread of democracy may help reduce the digital divide.},

We bring these data to bear on concerns raised by Prior (2013a) about the construct and convergent validity of the new ANES measures. Our results add nuance to previous findings showing respon- dents’ propensity to overreport exposure to news, and also demonstrate that on average, self-reported measures reflect relative levels of exposure quite well. Additionally, we show that the more unique news programs a person watches, the more total time he or she is exposed to political news. Very few people watch only one program but watch it repeatedly. The data also reveal an increase in the number of programs watched leading up to election day, and a concomitant increase in the amount of time per capita spent with political news as elections approach. We conclude, however, that the program– count measure is not without its weaknesses. Shortening the list of programs affects construct validity by introducing noise into the low end of the scale. Expanding the list of programs in the survey to include local news and special reports will improve fidelity at the low end of this new measure.},

abstract = {(from the chapter) It is more common to associate mass media with conflict than with social, political, or economic reconstruction. Ready at hand are examples of Holocaust propaganda, negative media portrayals of minorities during war and genocide in Bosnia, Serbia, and Rwanda, and ethnic propaganda via SMS and blogging in Kenya during its election violence. Media that incite conflict are not only attention-grabbing, they seem to work. For example, a recent analysis of Rwandan hate radio leading up to and during the genocide pins at least 9 percent, or 45,000 deaths, on hate radio broadcasts. However, media are also used for building peaceful social relations and for reconstructing communities economically and politically. Psychologists, who have studied how media can promote stereotyping, prejudice, and conflict, also study how media help to reconstruct communities. The social-psychological mechanisms supposed to underlie media aimed at reconstruction are in many cases similar to those thought to underlie conflict media. These mechanisms include individual cognitive, emotional, and motivational responses to media, in addition to facets of interpersonal communication and social influence sparked by media. This chapter takes the position that the design of media interventions should be informed by these psychological theories, and that psychologists can expand on their theories through the study of real-world media interventions. I begin by reviewing the types of media interventions most commonly launched to rebuild communities following conflict. I focus in particular on media that broadcast "public narratives." Public narratives are stories portrayed by news media, films, theater, and in radio or television dramas. After reviewing examples of media interventions that use public narratives to rebuild communities, I review the social-psychological theories that seek to explain media influence. I then describe two studies of post-conflict media interventions that tested some of these theoretical explanations. The chapter concludes with recommendations for theory and research supporting media efforts to rebuild communities following conflict. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).},

We assess the role of education, party polarization, and paid advertising in explaining trends in Americans' political knowledge and engagement. We show that the public's steady level of information and increased focus on policy in presidential politics reflects the high level of policy content in paid ads, which have compensated for the shift of news coverage toward candidate character, scandal, and the horse race.},

@book{Vavreck2009a,
abstract = {Vavreck argues for a prescriptive typology of campaign messages derived from Down's and Retrospective Voting models combined with her contention that candidates can influence voters in three ways: priming, agenda setting, and clarifying. This leads her to predict that candidates will either run "clarifying campaigns", in which they prime the importance of a growing or declining economy, or "insurgent campaigns", in which they carefully select insurgent issues on which to campaign, ideally of the type that the opposition candidate has a fixed position with a negative implication. She then shows how clarifying candidates tend to win on account of the importance and amorphous nature of the economy, but also that candidates who follow her framework are far more succesful than those who don't, and that this impact can be shown in the aggregate (with forecasting models) as well as at the individual level.},

@misc{Gerber2004b,
abstract = {This article reports the results of several field experiments designed to measure campaign effects in partisan contests. The findings suggest incumbent campaigns failed to increase incumbent vote share, whereas the challenger campaign was effective. To understand these and other results, the incumbent's optimal spending strategy was analyzed theoretically. The analysis reveals that if incumbents maximize their probability of victory rather than vote share, campaigns by typical incumbents are expected to produce only minimal improvement in incumbent vote share. The analysis also explains how returns to campaign spending vary with the competitiveness of the election, how incumbent spending can improve the incumbent's probability of victory yet have only minimal effect on incumbent vote share, and why rational spending plans might decrease the sponsor's expected vote. This article demonstrates the wide scope of application for field experiments and provides an example of how experimental findings can serve as a catalyst for generating theories.},

@article{Hansen2009b,
abstract = {Statistical analysis requires a probability model: commonly, a model for the dependence of outcomes Y on confounders X and a potentially causal variable Z. When the goal of the analysis is to infer Z's effects on Y , this requirement introduces an element of circularity: in order to decide how Z affects Y , the analyst first determines, speculatively, the manner of Y 's dependence on Z and other variables. This paper takes a statistical perspective that avoids such circles, permitting analysis of Z's effects on Y even as the statistician remains entirely agnostic about the conditional distribution of Y given X and Z, or perhaps even denies that such a distribution exists. Our assumptions instead pertain to the conditional distribution Z|X, and the role of speculation in settling them is reduced by the use of such techniques as propensity scores, poststratification, testing for overt bias before accepting a poststratification, and optimal full matching. Such beginnings pave the way for ``randomization inference'', an approach which, despite a long history in the analysis of designed experiments, is relatively new to political science and to other fields in which experimental data are rarely available. The approach applies to both experiments and observational studies. We illustrate this by applying it to analyze A. Gerber and D. Green's New Haven Vote 98 campaign. Conceived as both a get-out-the-vote campaign and a field experiment in political participation, the campaign as it turned out was in some ways more similar to an observational study than to a randomized experiment. Our analysis uses the strengths of the design of their study while adjusting for irregularities ignored by the original analysis. We estimate the number of voters who would not have voted had the campaign not prompted them to --- that is, the total number of votes attributable to the interventions of the campaigners. Both our statistical inferences about these attributable effects and the stratification and matching that precede them rely on quite recent developments from statistics; our matching, in particular, has novel features of potentially wide applicability. Our broad findings resemble those of the original analysis by Gerber and Green (2000), although in the small, the method offers additional information as to the campaign's effects upon interestingly different subgroups, such as older voters or those who have not voted in a previous election. },
