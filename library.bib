	Abstract = {This paper exploits the emotional connections and viewer attentiveness of mainstream media to evaluate the economic impact of financial education messages on debt management delivered through a popular television soap opera in South Africa. The study uses a symmetric encouragement design to compare outcomes of individuals who were randomly assigned to watch a soap opera with financial messages, ``Scandal!'' to those of individuals who were invited to watch a similar soap opera without financial messages, ``Muvhango.'' Both shows overlapped in evening primetime and had similar past viewership profiles. The financial storyline spanned two months and featured one of the leading characters of the show borrowing excessively and irresponsibly through hire-purchase, gambling, and ending up in financial distress; and eventually seeking help to find her way out. Two intermediate and one final follow-up surveys were conducted as part of the study. The analysis finds individuals assigned to watch Scandal had significantly higher financial knowledge of the issues highlighted in the soap opera storyline, in particular messages delivered by the leading character. On behavior, Scandal viewers were almost twice more likely to borrow from formal sources, less likely to engage in gambling, and less prone to enter hire purchase agreements. Messages promoting a national debt mediation helpline delivered by an external character did not sustain traction beyond immediate interest. Three qualitative focus groups highlight the importance of emotional connections with the leading character in motivating behavior change.},

@article{Rosenbaum2003,
	Abstract = {It is often said that an important consideration in judging whether an association between treatment and response is causal is the presence or absence of a dose-response relationship, that is, larger ostensible treatment effects when doses of treatment are larger. This criterion is widely discussed in textbooks and is often mentioned in empirical papers. At the same time, it is well known through both important examples and elementary theory that a treatment may cause dramatic effects with no dose-response relationship, and hidden biases may produce a dose-response relationship when the treatment is without effect. What does a dose-response relationship say about causality? It is observed here that a dose-response relationship may or may not reduce sensitivity to hidden bias, and whether it has or has not can be determined by a suitable analysis using the data at hand. Moreover, a study without a dose-response relationship may or may not be less sensitive to hidden bias than another study with such a relationship, and this, too, can be determined from the data at hand. An example concerning cytogenetic damage among professional painters is used to illustrate.},

	Abstract = {Social scientists almost always use statistical models
positing the dependent variable as a global, linear
function of X, despite suspicions that the social and
political world is not so simple, or that our theories are
so strong. Generalized additive models (GAMs) let
researchers fit each independent variable with arbitrary
nonparametric functions, but subject to the constraint that
the nonparametric effects combine additively. In this way
GAMs strike a sensible balance between the flexibility of
nonparametric techniques and the ease of interpretation and
familiarity of linear regression. GAMs thus offer social
scientists a practical methodology for improving on the
extant practice of global linearity by default. We
reanalyze published work from several subfields of
political science, highlighting the strengths (and
limitations) of GAMs. We estimate non-linear marginal
effects in a regression analysis of incumbent reelection,
nonparametric duration dependence in an analysis of cabinet
duration, and within-dyad interaction effects in a
reconsideration of the democratic peace hypothesis. We
conclude with a more general consideration of the
circumstances in which GAMs are likely to be of use to
political scientists, as well as some apparent limitations
of the technique.},

@article{DiPrete2004,
	Abstract = {Propensity score matching provides an estimate of the effect of a ``treatment'' variable on an outcome variable that is largely free of bias arising from an association between treatment status and observable variables. However, matching methods are not robust against ``hidden bias'' arising from unobserved variables that simultaneously affect assignment to treatment and the outcome variable. One strategy for addressing this problem is the Rosenbaum bounds approach, which allows the analyst to determine howstrongly an unmeasured confounding variable must affect selection into treatment in order to undermine the conclusions about causal effects from a matching analysis. Instrumental variables (IV) estimation provides an alternative strategy for the estimation of causal effects, but themethod typically reduces the precision of the estimate and has an additional source of uncertainty that derives from the untestable nature of the assumptions of the IV approach. A method of assessing this additional uncertainty is proposed so that the total uncertainty of the IVapproach can be compared with the Rosenbaumbounds approach to uncertainty using matching methods. Because the approaches rely on different information and different assump- tions, they provide complementary information about causal relationships. The approach is illustrated via an analysis of the impact of unemployment insurance on the timing of reemploy- ment, the postunemployment wage, and the probability of relo- cation, using data from several panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: It is generally thought that the use of preoperative antibiotics reduces the risk of postoperative infection, yet few studies have described the association between preoperative antibiotics and the risk of dying. The objective of this study was to determine whether preoperative antibiotics are associated with a reduced risk of death. METHODS: We performed a multivariate matched, population-based, case-control study of death following surgery on 1362 Pennsylvania Medicare patients between 65 and 85 years of age undergoing general and orthopedic surgery. Cases (681 deaths within 60 days from hospital admission) were randomly selected throughout Pennsylvania using claims from 1995 and 1996. Models were developed to scan Medicare claims, looking for controls who did not die and who were the closest matches to the previously selected cases based on preoperative characteristics. Cases and their controls were identified, and charts were abstracted to define antibiotic use and obtain baseline severity adjustment data. RESULTS: For general surgery, the odds of dying within 60 days were less than half in those treated with preoperative antibiotics within 2 hours of incision as compared with those without such treatment: (odds ratio = 0.44; 95\% confidence interval, 0.32-0.60), P < 0.0001). For orthopedic surgery, no significant mortality reduction was observed (OR = 0.85; 95\% confidence interval, 0.54-1.32; P < 0.464). INTERPRETATION: Preoperative antibiotics are associated with a substantially lower 60-day mortality rate in elderly patients undergoing general surgery. In patients who appear to be comparable, the risk of death was half as large among those who received preoperative antibiotics.},

@article{Greevy2004,
	Abstract = {Although blocking or pairing before randomization is a basic principle of experimental design, the principle is almost invariably applied to at most one or two blocking variables. Here, we discuss the use of optimal multivariate matching prior to randomization to improve covariate balance for many variables at the same time, presenting an algorithm and a case-study of its performance. The method is useful when all subjects, or large groups of subjects, are randomized at the same time. Optimal matching divides a single group of 2n subjects into n pairs to minimize covariate differences within pairs-the so-called nonbipartite matching problem-then one subject in each pair is picked at random for treatment, the other being assigned to control. Using the baseline covariate data for 132 patients from an actual, unmatched, randomized experiment, we construct 66 pairs matching for 14 covariates. We then create 10000 unmatched and 10000 matched randomized experiments by repeatedly randomizing the 132 patients, and compare the covariate balance with and without matching. By every measure, every one of the 14 covariates was substantially better balanced when randomization was performed within matched pairs. Even after covariance adjustment for chance imbalances in the 14 covariates, matched randomizations provided more accurate estimates than unmatched randomizations, the increase in accuracy being equivalent to, on average, a 7\% increase in sample size. In randomization tests of no treatment effect, matched randomizations using the signed rank test had substantially higher power than unmatched randomizations using the rank sum test, even when only 2 of 14 covariates were relevant to a simulated response. Unmatched randomizations experienced rare disasters which were consistently avoided by matched randomizations.},

	Abstract = {Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are unlike traditional individually randomized trials because observations within the same cluster are positively correlated and the sample size (number of clusters) is relatively small. Although formulae for sample size and power estimates of CRT designs do exist, these formulae rely upon first-order asymptotic approximations for the distribution of the average intervention effect and are inaccurate for CRTs that have a small number of clusters. These formulae also assume that the intracluster correlation (ICC) is the same for each cluster in the CRT. However, for CRTs in which the clusters are classrooms or medical practices, the degree of ICC is often a factor of how many students are in each classroom or how many patients are in each practice. Specifically, smaller clusters are expected to have larger ICC than larger clusters. A weighted sum of the cluster means, D, is the statistic often used to estimate the average intervention effect in a CRT. T},

	Abstract = {There is a tension regarding the potential of the alternative agro-food movement to create meaningful change. From one perspective, individual and organizational actors working to change the dominant food system need to be engaged on a daily basis in political and social struggles and accomplish what is presently possible given existing opportunities and barriers. From an alternate view, such pragmatism is woefully inadequate for achieving the complete transformation of the food and agriculture system that many movement actors and academic analysts see as necessary. This paper examines some of the issues underlying this tension. It is argued that the "sustainability" of food and agriculture systems is understandably a contested concept because it inevitably involves both conflicts over values and uncertainty about outcomes. These same characteristics make democracy the method of choice for the alternative agro-food movement, and this paper discusses the emerging concept of "food democracy" in order to elaborate upon its practical utility with respect to collective action. The existing alternative agro-food movement is the main source of the pressure to democratize the agro-food system. While the movement in the United States (and elsewhere) is very diverse in terms of organizational forms and strategies, there are important opportunities for developing coalitions among various groups. Lastly, food democracy is discussed as a pragmatic method for transforming the agro-food system.},

	Abstract = {Causal inference in an important topic and one that is now
attracting serious attention of statisticians. Although
there exist recent discussions concerning the general
definition of causal effects and a substantial literature
on specific techniques for the analysis of data in
randomized and nonrandomized studies, there has been
relatively little discussion of modes of statistical
inference for causal effects. This presentation briefly
describes and contrasts four basic modes of statistical
inference for causal effects, emphasizes the common
underlying causal framework with a posited assignment
mechanism, and describes practical implications in the
context of an example involving the effects of switching
from a name-brand to a generic drug. A fundamental
conclusion is that in such nonrandomized studies,
sensitivity of inference to the assignment mechanism is the
dominant issue, and it cannot be avoided by changing modes
of inference, for instance, by changing from
randomization-based to Bayesian methods.},

This is common, for instance, with additive treatment effects. The current paper uses 'attributable effects' to expand substantially the scope of pivotal argu- ments. Attributable effects are defined for three cases, namely the 2 x 2 contingency table, displacement effects and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistic, and in each case removing an appropriate attributable effect restores the familiar null randomisation distribution of the associated statistic, yielding exact inferences. The procedure extends immediately for use in sensitivity analysis in nonrandomised observational studies.},

@article{yang2011matching,
	Abstract = {Summary In multivariate matching, fine balance constrains the marginal distributions of a nominal variable in treated and matched control groups to be identical without constraining who is matched to whom. In this way, a fine balance constraint can balance a nominal variable with many levels while focusing efforts on other more important variables when pairing individuals to minimize the total covariate distance within pairs. Fine balance is not always possible; that is, it is a constraint on an optimization problem, but the constraint is not always feasible. We propose a new algorithm that returns a minimum distance finely balanced match when one is feasible, and otherwise minimizes the total distance among all matched samples that minimize the deviation from fine balance. Perhaps we can come very close to fine balance when fine balance is not attainable; moreover, in any event, because our algorithm is guaranteed to come as close as possible to fine balance, the investigator may perform one match, and on that basis judge whether the best attainable balance is adequate or not. We also show how to incorporate an additional constraint. The algorithm is implemented in two similar ways, first as an optimal assignment problem with an augmented distance matrix, second as a minimum cost flow problem in a network. The case of knee surgery in the Obesity and Surgical Outcomes Study motivated the development of this algorithm and is used as an illustration. In that example, 2 of 47 hospitals had too few nonobese patients to permit fine balance for the nominal variable with 47 levels representing the hospital, but our new algorithm came very close to fine balance. Moreover, in that example, there was a shortage of nonobese diabetic patients, and incorporation of an additional constraint forced the match to include all of these nonobese diabetic patients, thereby coming as close as possible to balance for this important but recalcitrant covariate.},

@article{Silber2009,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resident duty hour reforms of 2003 had the potential to create a major impact on the delivery of inpatient care. OBJECTIVE: We examine whether the reforms influenced the probability of a patient experiencing a prolonged hospital length of stay (PLOS), a measure reflecting either inefficiency of care or the development of complications that may slow the rate of discharge. RESEARCH DESIGN: Conditional logistic models to compare PLOS in more versus less teaching-intensive hospitals before and after the reform, adjusting for patient comorbidities, common time trends, and hospital site. SUBJECTS: Medicare (N = 6,059,015) and Veterans Affairs (VA) (N = 210,276) patients admitted for medical conditions (acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, or gastrointestinal bleeding) or surgical procedures (general, orthopedic, and vascular) from July 2000 to June 2005. MEASURES: Prolonged length of stay. RESULTS: Modeling all medical conditions together, the odds of prolonged stay in the first year post reform at more versus less teaching intensive hospitals was 1.01 (95\% CI: 0.97-1.05) for Medicare and 1.07 (0.94-1.20) for the VA. Results were similarly negative in the second year post reform. For "combined surgery" the post year 1 odds ratios were 1.04 (0.98-1.09) and 0.94 (0.78-1.14) for Medicare and the VA respectively, and similarly unchanged in post year 2. Isolated increases in the probability of prolonged stay did occur for some vascular surgery procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals generally found ways to cope with duty hour reform without increasing the prevalence of prolonged hospital stays, a marker of either inefficient care or complications.},

	Abstract = {The classical approach to the study of the transformation of social movements (here called the Weber-Michels model) predicts that a movement organization will become more conservative and that its goals will be displaced in favor of organizational maintenance. Using organizational and incentive analysis, the classical approach is subsumed under a more general set of concepts which lead to predictions about growth and change. The movement organization responds to the ebb and flow of sentiment in the larger society, to its relations with other movement organizations and to success or failure. Leadership and schismogenetic tendencies affect the nature and vicissitudes of its goals, and the recruitment and commitment of members. Neither greater conservatism nor organizational maintenance are iron laws.},

	Abstract = {In 2010, a magnitude 8.8 earthquake hit Chile, devastating parts of the country. Having just completed its national socioeconomic survey, the Chilean government reinterviewed a subsample of respondents, creating unusual longitudinal data about the same persons before and after a major disaster. The follow-up evaluated posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) using Davidson's Trauma Scale. We use these data with two goals in mind. Most studies of PTSS after disasters rely on recall to characterize the state of affairs before the disaster. We are able to use prospective data on preexposure conditions, free of recall bias, to study the effects of the earthquake. Second, we illustrate recent developments in statistical methodology for the design and analysis of observational studies. In particular, we use new and recent methods for multivariate matching to control 46 covariates that describe demographic variables, housing quality, wealth, health, and health insurance before the earthquake. We use the statistical theory of design sensitivity to select a study design with findings expected to be insensitive to small or moderate biases from failure to control some unmeasured covariate. PTSS were dramatically but unevenly elevated among residents of strongly shaken areas of Chile when compared with similar persons in largely untouched parts of the country. In 96\% of exposed-control pairs exhibiting substantial PTSS, it was the exposed person who experienced stronger symptoms (95\% confidence interval = 0.91-1.00).},

The trajectory groups also aid in characterizing classes of subjects for whom no good matches are available and to define substantively interesting groups between which treatment effects may vary. These and related methods are illustrated using data from a Montreal-based study. The effects on subsequent violence of gang joining at age 14 are studied while controlling for measured characteristics of boys prior to age 14. The boys are divided into trajectory groups based on violence from ages 11 to 13. Within trajectory group, joiners are optimally matched to a variable number of controls using propensity scores, Mahalanobis distances, and a combinatorial optimization algorithm. Use of variable ratio matching results in greater efficiency than pair matching and also greater bias reduction than matching at a fixed ratio. The possible impact of failing to adjust for an important but unmeasured covariate is examined using sensitivity analysis.},

They are rhetorical devices that are often invoked to avoid having to confront real econometric difficulties. Natural, quasi-, and computational experiments, as well as regression discontinuity design, can all, when well applied, be useful, but none are panaceas. The essay by Angrist and Pischke, in its enthusiasm for some real accomplishments in certain subfields of economics, makes overbroad claims for its favored methodologies. What the essay says about macroeconomics is mainly nonsense. Consequently, I devote the central part of my comment to describing the main developments that have helped take some of the con out of macroeconomics. Recent enthusiasm for single-equation, linear, instrumental variables approaches in applied microeconomics has led many in these fields to avoid undertaking research that would require them to think formally },

The methods discussed use only (i) the random assignment of clusters to treatment or control and (ii) the hypothesis about effects being tested or inverted for confidence intervals, so they are randomization inferences in Fisher's strict sense. There is no assumption that the covariance model generated the data, that compliers resemble noncompliers, that dependence is from additive random cluster effects, that individuals in a same cluster do not interfere with one another, or that units are sampled from a population. We contrast methods of covariance adjustment, never assuming the models are ?true,? obtaining exact randomization inferences. We consider exact inference about effects proportional to doses with noncompliance and effects whose magnitude varies with the degree of improvement that would occur without treatment. A simulation examines power. In the Prospect Study, in 10 pairs of two primary-care practices, one practice was picked at random to receive a ?depression care manager? to treat its depressed patients.

(2008b) 2 176--196] critiqued OLS regression adjustment of estimated treat- ment effects in randomized experiments, using Neyman's model for random- ization inference. This paper argues that in sufficiently large samples, the sta- tistical problems he raised are either minor or easily fixed. OLS adjustment improves or does not hurt asymptotic precision when the regression includes a full set of treatment-covariate interactions. Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be constructed with the Huber-White sandwich standard error estimator. Even the traditional OLS adjustment has benign large-sample prop- erties when subjects are randomly assigned to two groups of equal size. The strongest reasons to support Freedman's preference for unadjusted estimates are transparency and the dangers of specification search.

	Abstract = {An observational study is an attempt to estimate the effects of a treatment when subjects are not randomly assigned to treatment or control. The possibility of using more than one control group has often been briefly mentioned in general discussions of observational studies, and many observational studies have used two control groups. Here, the limited and dispersed literature on this subject is reviewed, and the topic is developed in several directions by using a formal notation for observational studies. The value of a second control group depends on the supplementary information that is available about unobserved biases that are suspected to exist. A second control group provides a test of the assumption that conventional adjustments for observed covariates suffice in estimating treatment effects. Under the best of circumstances, this test is consistent and unbiased, and its power exceeds the probability of falsely detecting a treatment effect. Indeed, under the best of circumstances, two control groups can yield consistent and unbiased estimates of bounds on the treatment effect when conventional adjustments fail. In contrast, however, in the worst of circumstances, a second control group can be of little value.},

@article{Rosenbaum2004a,
	Abstract = {In 1994 the School of Medicine of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, its clinical teachers, and the three principal teaching hospitals initiated a new approach to funding, the Alternative Funding Plan, a pragmatic response to the inability of fee-for-service billing by clinical faculty to subsidize the academic mission of the health sciences center. The center was funded to provide a package of service and academic deliverables (outputs), rather than on the basis of payment for physician clinical activity (inputs). The new plan required a new governance structure representing stakeholders and raised a number of important issues: how to reconcile the preservation of physician professional autonomy with corporate responsibilities; how to gather requisite information so as to equitably allocate resources; and how to report to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care in order to demonstrate accountability. In subsequent iterations of the agreement it was necessary to address issues of flexibility resulting from locked-in funding levels and to devise meaningful performance measures for departments and the center as a whole. The authors conclude that the Alternative Funding Plan represents a successful innovation in funding for an academic health sciences center in that it has created financial stability, as well as modest positive effects for education and research. The Ontario government hopes to replicate the model at the province's other four health sciences centers, and it may have applicability in any jurisdiction in which the costs of medical education outstrip the capacity of faculty clinical earnings.},

	Abstract = {Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are used in the analysis of cluster randomized trials (CRTs) because: 1) the resulting intervention effect estimate has the desired marginal or population-averaged interpretation, and 2) most statistical packages contain programs for GEE. However, GEE tends to underestimate the standard error of the intervention effect estimate in CRTs. In contrast, penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimates the standard error of the intervention effect in CRTs much better than GEE but is used less frequently because: 1) it generates an intervention effect estimate with a conditional, or cluster-specific, interpretation, and 2) PQL is not a part of most statistical packages. We propose taking the variance estimator from PQL and re-expressing it as a sandwich-type estimator that could be easily incorporated into existing GEE packages, thereby making GEE useful for the analysis of CRTs. Using numerical examples and data from an actual CRT, we compare the performance of this variance estimator to others proposed in the literature, and we find that our variance estimator performs as well as or better than its competitors.},

@article{Morg:01,
	Abstract = {School-effects research in sociology cannot be separated
from concerns about causality. Purely descriptive modeling
justifications are untenable. Focusing on the Catholic
school effect on learning, this article demonstrates an
approach that places regression modeling strategies within
a specific and well-developed framework for thinking about
causality. While regression models should properly remain
the workhorse methodology for school-effects research,
regression estimates should more often be subject to
exacting interpretations and presented alongside
alternative estimates of more specific parameters of
interest. In this demonstration, propensity- score matching
estimates of the Catholic school effect for the Catholic
schooled are provided to supplement the estimates obtained
by regression models. Although subject to their own set of
weaknesses, the matching estimates suggest that the
Catholic school effect is the strongest among those
Catholic school students who, according to their observed
characteristics, are least likely to attend Catholic
schools. Four alternative explanations are offered for this
finding, each of which should be pursued in further

	Abstract = {A central theme of research on human development and psychopathology is whether a therapeutic intervention or a turning-point event, such as a family break-up, alters the trajectory of the behavior under study. This article describes and applies a method for using observational longitudinal data to make more transparent causal inferences about the impact of such events on developmental trajectories. The method combines 2 distinct lines of research: work on the use of finite mixture modeling to analyze developmental trajectories and work on propensity score matching. The propensity scores are used to balance observed covariates and the trajectory groups are used to control pretreatment measures of response. The trajectory groups also aid in characterizing classes of subjects for which no good matches are available. The approach is demonstrated with an analysis of the impact of gang membership on violent delinquency based on data from a large longitudinal study conducted in Montr\'{e}al, Canada.},

Our aims are to (1) correct errors in the SCA response rate data that affected Curtin, Presser, and Singer's (2000) result, (2) examine the trend in SCA response rates after 1996, when caller identification technology became widespread, and (3) describe the roles played by the various sources of SCA nonresponse over time. The results show that the response rate decline from 1979 to 1996 was larger than described by Curtin, Presser, and Singer (2000); the response rate drop was significantly steeper from 1996 to 2003 than from 1979 to 1996; and the 1979 to 2003 trends differed substantially for refusals and noncontacts.},

	Abstract = {Causal inference in an important topic and one that is now
attracting serious attention of statisticians. Although
there exist recent discussions concerning the general
definition of causal effects and a substantial literature
on specific techniques for the analysis of data in
randomized and nonrandomized studies, there has been
relatively little discussion of modes of statistical
inference for causal effects. This presentation briefly
describes and contrasts four basic modes of statistical
inference for causal effects, emphasizes the common
underlying causal framework with a posited assignment
mechanism, and describes practical implications in the
context of an example involving the effects of switching
from a name-brand to a generic drug. A fundamental
conclusion is that in such nonrandomized studies,
sensitivity of inference to the assignment mechanism is the
dominant issue, and it cannot be avoided by changing modes
of inference, for instance, by changing from
randomization-based to Bayesian methods.},

Although the assumption of no interference is often necessary for causal inference, few options are available for testing this assumption. This article presents an ex post method for detecting interference between units in randomized experiments. With a test statistic of the analyst's choice, a conditional randomization test allows for the calculation of the exact significance level of the causal dependence of outcomes on the treatment status of other units. The robustness of the method is demonstrated through simulation studies. Moreover, using this method, interference between units is detected in a field experiment designed to assess the effect of mailings on voter turnout in a U.S. primary election.},

	Abstract = {The article considers several working anarchies in the networked environment, and whether they offer a model for improving on the persistent imperfections of markets and states. I explore whether these efforts of peer mutualism in fact offer a sufficient range of capabilities to present a meaningful degree of freedom to those who rely on the capabilities it affords, and whether these practices in fact remain sufficiently nonhierarchical to offer a meaningful space of noncoercive interactions. The real utopias I observe here are perfect on neither dimension. Internally, hierarchy and power reappear, to some extent and in some projects, although they are quite different than the hierarchy of government or corporate organization. Externally, there are some spectacular successes, some failures to thrive, and many ambiguous successes. In all, present experience supports neither triumphalism nor defeatism in the utopian project. Peer models do work, and they do provide a degree of freedom in the capabilities they provide. But there is no inexorable path to greater freedom through voluntary open collaboration. There is a good deal of uncertainty and muddling through. The last part of the article suggests a theory of freedom that supports the significance of even these obviously imperfect peer systems with incomplete coverage of necessary human capabilities, and explains why expanding the domain of mutualism improves freedom and well-being under conditions of persistent market imperfection and an inevitably fallible state. Peer mutualism doesn't have to be perfect; it merely needs to offer a new dimension or sufficient diversity in how it instantiates capabilities and transmits power to offer us, who inhabit the systems that these peer systems perturb, a degree of freedom.},

Findings about parental influence based on youth coming of age in the 1990s strongly parallel those based on youth socialized in the 1960s. As expected on the basis of social learning theory, children are more likely to adopt their parents' political orientations if the family is highly politicized and if the parents provide consistent cues over time. The direct transmission model is robust, as it withstands an extensive set of controls. Early acquisition of parental characteristics influences the subsequent nature of adult political development.},

	Abstract = {What has always bothered me about the ``experimentalist'' school is the false sense of certainty it conveys. My view, like Leamer's, is that there is no way to escape the role of assumptions in statistical work, so our conclusions will always be contingent. Hence, we should be circumspect about our degree of knowledge. I present some lessons for economics from the field of marketing, a field where broad consensus has been reached on many key issues over the past twenty years. In marketing, 1) the structural paradigm is dominant, 2) the data are a lot better than in some fields of economics, and 3) there is great emphasis on external validation. Of course, good data always helps. I emphasize that the ability to do controlled experiments does not obviate the need for theory, and finally I address different approaches to model validation.

@article{Silber2007,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Procedure times are important variables that often are included in studies of quality and efficiency. However, due to the need for costly chart review, most studies are limited to single-institution analyses. In this article, the authors describe how well the anesthesia claim from Medicare can estimate chart times. METHODS: The authors abstracted information on time of induction and entrance to the recovery room ("anesthesia chart time") from the charts of 1,931 patients who underwent general and orthopedic surgical procedures in Pennsylvania. The authors then merged the associated bills from claims data supplied from Medicare (Part B data) that included a variable denoting the time in minutes for the anesthesia service. The authors also investigated the time from incision to closure ("surgical chart time") on a subset of 1,888 patients. RESULTS: Anesthesia claim time from Medicare was highly predictive of anesthesia chart time (Kendall's rank correlation tau = 0.85, P < 0.0001, median absolute error = 5.1 min) but somewhat less predictive of surgical chart time (Kendall's tau = 0.73, P < 0.0001, median absolute error = 13.8 min). When predicting chart time from Medicare bills, variables reflecting procedure type, comorbidities, and hospital type did not significantly improve the prediction, suggesting that errors in predicting the chart time from the anesthesia bill time are not related to these factors; however, the individual hospital did have some influence on these estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesia chart time can be well estimated using Medicare claims, thereby facilitating studies with vastly larger sample sizes and much lower costs of data collection.},

deductive reasoning, the theoretical route. However
inductive logic, the experimental method, is also feasible

clarify the issues in cases where there are long-standing

problem of the marginal totals in Fisher's exact test. It
becomes clear that both margins should be fixed. We
conclude that there are advantages if the strategy natural

introduces a model for the analysis of field experiments
conducted for the purpose of comparing a number of crop
varieties, which makes use of a double-indexed array of
unknown potential yields, one index corresponding to
varieties and the other to plots. The yield corresponding
to only one variety will be observed on any given plot, but
through an urn model embodying sampling without replacement
from this doubly indexed array, Neyman obtains a formula
for the variance of the difference between the averages of
the observed yields of two varieties. This variance
involves the variance over all plots of the potential
yields and the correlation coefficient r between the
potential yields of the two varieties on the same plot.
Since it is impossible to estimate r directly, Neyman
advises taking r = 1, observing that in practice this may
lead to using too large an estimated standard deviation,
when comparing two variety means.},

Extending earlier results on attributable effects in unmatched groups, a method of exact randomization inference and sensitivity analysis is developed for case-referent, case-crossover, and cohort studies with matched sets, and a large sample approximation to the exact inference is given. The unmatched case, considered previously, has certain symmetries that the matched case, considered here, does not have. As a result, approximation for the matched case requires the use of the recently developed method of asymptotic separability, which was riot needed in the unmatched case. Several examples are presented, including a case-referent study of Helicobacter pylori infection as a cause of myocardial infarction, a case-crossover study of alcohol as a cause of injury, a cohort study of women who gave birth at home, and a study of the effects of cadmium exposure with a continuous outcome measuring kidney function. Unlike tests of no effect, inference about attributable effects has a different form in case-referent and cohort studies.},

	Abstract = {An instrument or instrumental variable manipulates a treatment and affects the outcome only indirectly through its manipulation of the treatment. For instance, encouragement to exercise might increase cardiovascular fitness, but only indirectly to the extent that it increases exercise. If instrument levels are randomly assigned to individuals, then the instrument may permit consistent estimation of the effects caused by the treatment, even though the treatment assignment itself is far from random. For instance, one can conduct a randomized experiment assigning some subjects to 'encouragement to exercise' and others to 'no encouragement' but, for reasons of habit or taste, some subjects will not exercise when encouraged and others will exercise without encouragement; none-the-less, such an instrument aids in estimating the effect of exercise. Instruments that are weak, i.e. instruments that have only a slight effect on the treatment, present inferential problems. We evaluate a recent proposal for permutation inference with an instrumental variable in four ways: using Angrist and Krueger's data on the effects of education on earnings using quarter of birth as an instrument, following Bound, Jaeger and Baker in using simulated independent observations in place of the instrument in Angrist and Krueger's data, using entirely simulated data in which correct answers are known and finally using statistical theory to show that only permutation inferences maintain correct coverage rates. The permutation inferences perform well in both easy and hard cases, with weak instruments, as well as with long-tailed responses.},

	Abstract = {Hierarchical or \{"\}multilevel\{"\} regression models
typically parameterize the mean response conditional on
unobserved latent variables or \{"\}random\{"\} effects and
then make simple assumptions regarding their distribution.
The interpretation of a regression parameter in such a
model is the change in possibly transformed mean response
per unit change in a particular predictor having controlled
for all conditioning variables including the random
effects. An often overlooked limitation of the conditional
formulation for nonlinear models is that the interpretation
of regression coefficients and their estimates can be
highly sensitive to difficult-to-verify assumptions about
the distribution of random effects, particularly the
dependence of the latent variable distribution on
covariates. In this article, we present an alternative
parameterization for the multilevel model in which the
marginal mean, rather than the conditional mean given
random effects, is regressed on covariates. The impact of
random effects model violations on the marginal and more
traditional conditional parameters is compared through
calculation of asymptotic relative biases. A simple
two-level example from a study of teratogenicity is
presented where the binomial overdispersion depends on the
binary treatment assignment and greatly influences
likelihood-based estimates of the treatment effect in the
conditional model. A second example considers a three-level
structure where attitudes toward abortion over time are
correlated with person and district level covariates. We
observe that regression parameters in conditionally
specified models are more sensitive to random effects
assumptions than their counterparts in the marginal
formulation.},

	Abstract = {An observational or nonrandomized study of treatment effects may be biased by failure to control for some relevant covariate that was not measured. The design of an observational study is known to strongly affect its sensitivity to biases from covariates that were not observed. For instance, the choice of an outcome to study, or the decision to combine several outcomes in a test for coherence, can materially affect the sensitivity to unobserved biases. Decisions that shape the design are, therefore, critically important, but they are also difficult decisions to make in the absence of data.We consider the possibility of randomly splitting the data from an observational study into a smaller planning sample and a larger analysis sample, where the planning sample is used to guide decisions about design. After reviewing the concept of design sensitivity, we evaluate sample splitting in theory, by numerical computation, and by simulation, comparing it to several methods that use all of the data. Sample splitting is remarkably effective, much more so in observational studies than in randomized experiments: splitting 1,000 matched pairs into 100 planning pairs and 900 analysis pairs often materially improves the design sensitivity. An example from genetic toxicology is used to illustrate the method.},

	Abstract = {Matching is a common method of adjustment in observational studies. Currently, matched samples are constructed using greedy heuristics (or" stepwise" procedures) that produce, in general, suboptimal matchings. With respect to a particualr criterion, a matched sample is suboptimal if it could be improved by changing the controls assigned to specific treated units, that is, if it could be improved with the data at hand. Here, optimal matched samples are obtained using network flow theory. In addition to providing optimal matched-pair samples, this approach yields optimal constructions for several statistical matching problems that have not been studied previously, including the construction of matched samples with multiple controls, with a variable number of controls, and the construction of balanced matched samples that combine features of pair matching and frequency matching. Computational efficiency is discussed. Extensive use is made of ideas from two essentially disjoint literatures, namely statistical matching in observational studies and graph algorithms for matching. The article contains brief reviews of both topics.},

@misc{Rosenbaum2005c,
	Abstract = {In an effort to determine whether a particular treatment causes a particular outcome event, data are obtained from a database system that records events when they occur, and for such events, the system records exposure to the treatment. That is, the system records information about cases. The system provides no information about events that might have occurred but did not, that is, about units which are not cases. Roughly speaking, we know the number of successes for two proportions, treated and control, but not the numbers of trials or units for these proportions; indeed, the concept of a "trial" may be somewhat vague. With no further information, the situation is quite hopeless. However, an interesting strategy that is sometimes used entails identifying two types of cases whose origin is entirely different so that it is known the cases of the second type were definitely not affected by the treatment under study. This strategy--the case-case or case2-study--seems to have been reinvented independently many times, and has recently been offered as a general strategy for infectious disease epidemiology by McCarthy and Giesecke (1999, International Journal of Epidemiology 28, 764-768). Can this strategy permit estimation of the number of cases caused by the treatment? Using attributable effects in a new way, a method of exact inference is proposed, along with a large sample approximation. Two examples are discussed: one concerning the effects of daytime running lights (DRLs) on the risk of multivehicle accidents; the other concerning the origin of a Salmonella infection. A counterexample with superficially similar appearance is also discussed concerning suicide rates following the publication of Final Exit; here, the treatment may alter the outcome, or it may alter the type, and the attributable effect cannot be estimated.},

	Abstract = { An instrument or instrumental variable manipulates a treatment and$\backslash$naffects the outcome only indirectly through its manipulation of the$\backslash$ntreatment. For instance, encouragement to exercise might increase$\backslash$ncardiovascular fitness, but only indirectly to the extent that it$\backslash$nincreases exercise. If instrument levels are randomly assigned to$\backslash$nindividuals, then the instrument may permit consistent estimation$\backslash$nof the effects caused by the treatment, even though the treatment$\backslash$nassignment itself is far from random. For instance, one can conduct$\backslash$na randomized experiment assigning some subjects to 'encouragement$\backslash$nto exercise' and others to 'no encouragement' but, for reasons of$\backslash$nhabit or taste, some subjects will not exercise when encouraged and$\backslash$nothers will exercise without encouragement; none-the-less, such an$\backslash$ninstrument aids in estimating the effect of exercise. Instruments$\backslash$nthat are weak, i.e. instruments that have only a slight effect on$\backslash$nthe treatment, present inferential problems. We evaluate a recent$\backslash$nproposal for permutation inference with an instrumental variable$\backslash$nin four ways: using Angrist and Krueger's data on the effects of$\backslash$neducation on earnings using quarter of birth as an instrument, following$\backslash$nBound, Jaeger and Baker in using simulated independent observations$\backslash$nin place of the instrument in Angrist and Krueger's data, using entirely$\backslash$nsimulated data in which correct answers are known and finally using$\backslash$nstatistical theory to show that \&quot;only\&quot; permutation inferences$\backslash$nmaintain correct coverage rates. The permutation inferences perform$\backslash$nwell in both easy and hard cases, with weak instruments, as well$\backslash$nas with long-tailed responses. Copyright 2005 Royal Statistical Society.},

	Abstract = {Randomization in experiments allows researchers to assume that the treatment and con- trol groups are balanced with respect to all characteristics except the treatment. As such, treatment effects can be estimated with a simple difference of means-no other covariates are necessary. Still, analysts often adjust using experimental data for additional covariates with statistical models. In this paper, we address the issue of adjustment with experimental data. First, we outline the motivations for adjustment of experimental. We then review design based and analytic strategies for addressing these underlying motivations. We offer a com- parison of the most common method of adjustment---the standard least squares regression to estimate an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model---to two methods of statistical ad- justment that avoid ANCOVA's strong functional form assumption: Rosenbaum's method of covariate adjustment and matching. For all methods of adjustment, we outline a design and analytic strategy that maximizes transparency and illuminates whether inferences are adjustment dependent. Finally, we evaluate these methods of adjustment and demonstrate our design strategy with an original experiment on racial priming.},

Second, the sensitivity of the test to hidden bias is
examined. The question is whether a coherent pattern of

and prognostic models in estimating treatment effects from
observational studies. One issue investigated was the
effect of estimating the propensity score on estimators of
treatment effect. It was found that estimating the
propensity score introduced no additional bias. A second
question addressed comparisons of the propensity score and
prognostic approach when a confounder is omitted. The
results indicate that biases due to omitted covariates are
large and of the same magnitude. Third, misspecifications
of the propensity score were compared to misspecified
response models. Here it was found that estimators obtained
from incorrect response models had much larger biases than
estimators from incorrectly estimated propensity scores. In
all cases there were two types of models, one involving a
continuous and one a binary response. Least squares
estimators for the continuous response were compared to
stratified mean differences between treatment groups. For
the binary response maximum likelihood estimators of the
odds ratio were compared to Mantel-Haenszel estimators. In
both cases the strata were based on the quintiles of the
true and estimated propensity scores.},

In an effort to compensate for the lack of randomization, treated and control units are often matched on the basis of observed covariates; however, the possibility remains of bias due to residual imbalances in unobserved covariates. A general though simple method is proposed for displaying the sensitivity of permutation inferences to a range of assumptions about unobserved covariates in matched observational studies. The sensitivity analysis is applicable to Wilcoxon's signed rank test, to the McNemar-Cox test for paired binary responses, and to some matching problems with a variable number of controls.},

function is the joint distribution of the data and the

a function of the parameters and these inferential
variables. LP is based on this likelihood, and the
principles of sufficiency (SP) and conditionality (CP) are
modified such that the equivalence SP and CP \&\#8660; LP is
valid, generalizing Birnbaum's theorem.},

	Abstract = {When experimental designs are infeasible, researchers must
resort to the use of observational data from surveys,
censuses, and administrative records. Because assignment to
the independent variables of observational data is usually
nonrandom, the challenge of estimating causal effects with
observational data can be formidable. In this chapter, we
review the large literature produced primarily by
statisticians and econometricians in the past two decades
on the estimation of causal effects from observational
data. We first review the now widely accepted
counterfactual framework for the modeling of causal
effects. After examining estimators, both old and new, that
can be used to estimate causal effects from cross-sectional
data, we present estimators that exploit the additional
information furnished by longitudinal data. Because of the
size and technical nature of the literature, we cannot
offer a fully detailed and comprehensive presentation.
Instead, we present only the main features of methods that
are accessible and potentially of use to quantitatively
oriented sociologists.},

Microarrays epitomize this type of technology, but similar situations arise in proteomics, spectroscopy, imaging, and social science surveys. This paper uses false discovery rate methods to carry out both size and power calculations on large-scale problems. A simple empirical Bayes approach allows the false discovery rate (fdr) analysis to proceed with a minimum of frequentist or Bayesian modeling assumptions. Closed-form accuracy formulas are derived for estimated false discovery rates, and used to compare different methodologies: local or tail-area fdr's, theoretical, permutation, or empirical null hypothesis estimates. Two microarray data sets as well as simulations are used to evaluate the methodology, the power diagnostics showing why nonnull cases might easily fail to appear on a list of ``significant'' discoveries.

A resulting consequence is that researchers conducting such trials are faced with a multitude of design choices, including selection of the primary unit of inference, the degree to which clusters should be matched or stratified by prognostic factors at baseline, and decisions related to cluster subsampling. Moreover, application of ethical principles developed for individually randomized trials may also require modification. We discuss several topics related to these issues, with emphasis on the choices that must be made in the planning stages of a trial and on some potential pitfalls to be avoided.

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Institutional complication rates are often used to assess hospital quality of care, particularly for conditions and procedures where mortality rates are not useful because deaths are rare. The objective of this study was to assess the correlation among hospital quality assessment rankings based on adjusted mortality, complication and failure-to-rescue rates. DESIGN: This study used a clinically detailed administrative data set to compare severity and case-mix adjusted hospital outcome rankings for three different measures of quality of care: in-hospital death, complication and failure-to-rescue (in-hospital death following a complication). SETTING AND PATIENTS: Analysis of 74,647 patients who underwent general surgical procedures included in the 1991 and 1992 MedisGroups National Comparative Data Base. MEASUREMENTS: Adjusted outcomes of death, complication and failure to rescue based on multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: For 142 hospitals, the correlation between hospital rankings based on the death rate and those ranked by the complication rate was only 0.208 (P = 0.013). A similarly low correlation was present between the complication and failure rate rankings, r = -0.090 (P = 0.287). A higher correlation was observed between the death and failure rate rankings, r = 0.90 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: For general surgical procedures, hospital rank using the complication rate is poorly correlated with rankings using the death or failure rate. Complication rates should be used with great caution and should not be used in isolation when assessing hospital quality of care.},

	Abstract = {Direct adjustment or standardization applies population weights to subclass means in an effort to estimate population quantities from a sample that is not representative of the population. Direct adjustment has several attractive features, but when there are many subclasses it can attach large weights to small quantities of data, often in a fairly erratic manner. In the extreme, direct adjustment can attach infinite weight to nonexistent data, a noticeable inconvenience in practice. This article proposes a method of model-based direct adjustment that preserves the attractive features of conventional direct adjustment while stabilizing the weights attached to small subclasses. The sample mean and conventional direct adjustment are both special cases of model-based direct adjustment under two different extreme models for the subclass-specific selection probabilities. The discussion of this method provides some insights into the behavior of true and estimated propensity scores: the estimated scores are better than the true ones for almost the same reason that direct adjustment can outperform the sample mean in a simple random sample. The method is applied to a nonrandom sample in an effort to estimate a discrete distribution of essay scores in the College Board's Advanced Placement Examination in Biology.

	Abstract = {In the simplest case-only design, cases of a disease are cross-classified into a 2 x 2 table describing a genotype attribute and exposure to some environmental agent. In some instances, the genetic attribute has described inherited genes; in other instances, it has described mutations, for instance, damage to proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes leading to cancer. Here, the population case-only odds ratio is written as a causal parameter in terms of potential outcomes with and without exposure to the agent. It is shown that the case-only odds ratio makes sense as a causal parameter with inherited genes, but its magnitude does not have a causal interpretation with mutations, although deviations from 1 do provide information. The difference is that the environmental agent certainly did not cause an individual to inherit particular genes, but it may have caused the mutation.},

@book{Wuth:02,
	Abstract = {It has become common to lament Americans' tendency to
pursue individual interests apart from any institutional
association. But to those who charge that Americans are at
home watching television rather than getting involved in
their communities, Robert Wuthnow answers that while
certain kinds of civic engagement may be declining,
innovative new forms are taking their place. People are
still connected, but because of the realities of daily
life, they form ``loose connections.'' These more fluid
groups are better suited to dealing with today's needs than
the fraternal orders and ladies' auxiliaries of the past.
Wuthnow examines the challenges that must be faced if these
innovative forms of civic involvement are to flourish.
``America has always been a nation of joiners. Loose
Connections argues that we still have the habit, and it is
a good one, of reaching out and connecting to others in
order to participate in the civic life of our culture.
Wuthnow is an indispensable observer of the American civic
and religious scene.'' --Jean Bethke Elshtain, author of
Democracy on Trial ``This is a very important book,
especially in the context of the current debate over
'social capital' in America. Wuthnow presents an optimistic
picture of the state of American voluntary institutions.
One might sum up his view by saying that Alexis de
Tocqueville has still not been proven wrong.'' --Peter

In the present article we give examples to show that the conditionality principle should not be taken to be of universal validity, and we discuss some consequences of these examples.},

He next covers graphical methods for examining and transforming data, linear least-squares regression, dummy-variables regression, and analysis of variance. Fox also explores diagnostic methods for discovering whether a linear model fit to data adequately represents the data; extensions to linear least squares, including logit and probit models, time-series regression, nonlinear regression, robust regression, and nonparametric regression; and empirical methods for assessing sampling variation, including the bootstrap and cross-validation. More difficult material is segregated in separate sections and chapters and several appendixes are also included presenting background information. Scholars, professionals, researchers, and students in research methods, evaluation, education, sociology, and psychology will appreciate the enhanced and thorough treatment that regression analysis, linear models, and other related methods have received by author John Fox. </P>},

	Abstract = {
Exact small-sample methods for discrete data use probability distributions that do not depend on unknown parameters. However, they are conservative inferentially: the actual error probabilities for tests and confidence intervals are bounded above by the nominal level. This article surveys ways of reducing or even eliminating the conservatism. Fuzzy inference is a recent innovation that enables one to achieve the error probability exactly. We present a simple way of conducting fuzzy inference for discrete one-parameter exponential family distributions. In practice, most scientists would find this approach unsuitable yet might be disappointed by the conservatism of ordinary exact methods. Thus, we recommend using exact small-sample distributions but with inferences based on the mid-P value. This approach can be motivated by fuzzy inference, it is less conservative than standard exact methods, yet usually it does well in terms of achieving desired error probabilities. We illustrate for inferences about the binomial parameter.},

	Abstract = {Shareholder-owned corporations were the central pillars of the US economy in the twentieth century. Due to the success of the shareholder value movement and the widespread ``Nikefication'' of production, however, public corporations have become less concentrated, less integrated, less interconnected at the top, shorter-lived, and less prevalent since the turn of the twenty-first century, and there is reason to expect that their significance will continue to dwindle. We are left with both pathologies (heightened inequality, lower mobility, and a fragmented social safety net) and new technologies suitable for being repurposed in more democratic forms. Local solutions for producing, distributing, and sharing can provide functional alternatives to corporations for both production and employment; what is needed is the social organization to match the tools that we already have, or will have shortly. The time for democratic local economic forms prophesied by generations of activists may finally be at hand.},

Asymptotic representations are provided for various statistics, including mio-stage least squares (TSLS) and limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimators, Wald statistics, and statistics testing overidentification and endogeneity. The asymptotic distributions are found to provide good approximations to sampling distributions with 10-20 observations per instrument. The theory suggests concrete guidelines for applied work, including using nonstandard methods for construction of confidence regions. These results are used to interpret Angrist and Krueger's (1991) estimates of the returns to education: whereas TSLS estimates with many instruments approach the OLS estimate of 6\%, the more reliable LIML estimates with fewer instruments fall between 8\% and 10\%, with a typical 95\% confidence interval of (5\%, 15\%).},

When a patient receives the treatment at time t, that patient is matched to another patient with a similar history of symptoms up to time t who has not received the treatment up to time t; this is risk set matching. By using a penalty function in integer programming in a new way, we force the marginal distributions of symptoms to be balanced in the matched treated and control groups. Among all balanced matchings, we pick the one that is optimal in the sense of minimizing the multivariate pretreatment covariate distance within matched pairs. Under a simple model for the treatment assignment mechanism, we study the sensitivity of the findings to hidden biases. In particular, we show that a simple, conventional sensitivity analysis is appropriate with risk set matching when the time to treatment follows a proportional hazards model with a time-dependent unobserved covariate.},

	Abstract = {Alternative food initiatives are appearing in many places. Observers suggest that they share a political agenda: to oppose the structures that coordinate and globalize the current food system and to create alternative systems of food production that are environmentally sustainable, economically viable, and socially just. This paper examines the potential of these initiatives through the lens of the concepts of `alternative and oppositional' social movements and `militant particularism and global ambition' developed by Raymond Williams and David Harvey. The three sections of this paper review (1) the current discussion of common themes and strategies in agrifood initiatives within the academic literature; (2) the history of these initiatives in California; and (3) results of our interviews with 37 current leaders of California organizations. We suggest that further understanding these initiatives, and success in the goals of the initiatives themselves, requires us to look past their similarities to examine their differences. These differences are related to the social forms and relations that have been established in the places from which these initiatives arise. `Social justice,' in particular, may be difficult to construct at a `local' scale.},

students majoring in statistics who have a solid

stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
being more concerned with understanding basic statistical

Gibson-Graham offer already existing alternatives to a global capitalist order and outline strategies for building alternative economies. <br> <br> <i>A Postcapitalist Politics</i> reveals a prolific landscape of economic diversity---one that is not exclusively or predominantly capitalist---and examines the challenges and successes of alternative economic interventions. Gibson-Graham bring together political economy, feminist poststructuralism, and economic activism to foreground the ethical decisions, as opposed to structural imperatives, that construct economic ``development'' pathways. Marshalling empirical evidence from local economic projects and action research in the United States, Australia, and Asia, they produce a distinctive political imaginary with three intersecting moments: a politics of language, of the subject, and of collective action. In the face of an almost universal sense of surrender to capitalist globalization, this book demonstrates that postcapitalist subjects, economies, and communities can be fostered. The authors describe a politics of possibility that can build different economies in place and over space. They urge us to confront the forces that stand in the way of economic experimentation and to explore different ways of moving from theory to action. <br> <br> J. K. Gibson-Graham is the pen name of Katherine Gibson and Julie Graham, feminist economic geographers who work, respectively, at the Australian National University in Canberra and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</div>},

The differential effect of the two treatments is the effect of applying one treatment in lieu of the other. In randomised experiments, the differential effect is of no more or less interest than other treatment contrasts. Differential effects play a special role in certain observational studies in which treatments are not assigned to subjects at random, where differing outcomes may reflect biased assignments rather than effects caused by the treatments. Differential effects are immune to certain types of unobserved bias, called generic biases, which are associated with both treatments in a similar way. This is explored using several examples and models. Differential effects are not immune to differential biases, whose possible consequences are examined by sensitivity analysis.},

@misc{Small2008a,
	Abstract = {An instrument manipulates a treatment that it does not entirely control, but the instrument affects the outcome only indirectly through its manipulation of the treatment. The idealized prototype is the randomized encouragement design, in which subjects are randomly assigned to receive either encouragement to accept the treatment or no such encouragement, but not all subjects comply by doing what they are encouraged to do, and the situation is such that only the treatment itself, not disregarded encouragement alone, can affect the outcome. An instrument is weak if it has only a slight impact on acceptance of the treatment, that is, if most people disregard encouragement to accept the treatment. Typical applications of instrumental variables are not ideal; encouragement is not randomized, although it may be assigned in a far less biased manner than the treatment itself. Using the concept of design sensitivity, we study the sensitivity of instrumental variable analyses to departures from the ideal of random assignment of encouragement, with particular reference to the strength of the instrument. With these issues in mind, we reanalyze a clever study by Angrist and Krueger concerning the effects of military service during World War II on subsequent earnings, in which birth cohorts of very similar but not identical age were differently ``encouraged'' to serve in the war. A striking feature of this example is that those who served earned more, but the effect of service on earnings appears to be negative; that is, the instrumental variables analysis reverses the sign of the naive comparison. For expository purposes, this example has the convenient feature of enabling, by selecting different birth cohorts, the creation of instruments of varied strength, from extremely weak to fairly strong, although separated by the same time interval and thus perhaps similarly biased. No matter how large the sample size becomes, even if the effect under study is quite large, studies with weak instruments are extremely sensitive to tiny biases, whereas studies with stronger instruments can be insensitive to moderate biases.},

@article{Polsky2006,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigates geographic variation in chemotherapy utilization for ovarian cancer in both absolute and relative terms and examines area characteristics associated with this variation. DATA SOURCES: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare data from 1990 to 2001 for Medicare patients over 65 with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer between 1990 and 1999. Chemotherapy within a year of diagnosis was identified by Medicare billing codes. The hospital referral region (HRR) represents the geographic unit of analysis. STUDY DESIGN: A logit model predicting the probability of receiving chemotherapy by each of the 39 HRRs. Control variables included medical characteristics (patient age, stage, year of diagnosis, and comorbidities) and socioeconomic characteristics (race, income, and education). The variation among HRRs was tested by the chi2 statistic, and the relative contribution was measured by the omega statistic. HHR market characteristic are then used to explain HRR-level variation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The average chemotherapy rate was 56.6 percent, with a range by HRR from 33 percent to 67 percent. There were large and significant differences in chemotherapy use between HRRs, reflected by a chi2 for HRR of 146 (df = 38, p < .001). HRR-level variation in chemotherapy use can be partially explained by higher chemotherapy rates in HRRs with a higher percentage of hospitals with oncology services. However, an omega analysis indicates that, by about 15 to one, the variation between patients in use of chemotherapy reflects variations in patient characteristics rather than unexplained variation among HRRs. CONCLUSIONS: While absolute levels of chemotherapy variation between geographic areas are large and statistically significant, this analysis suggests that the role of geography in determining who gets chemotherapy is small relative to individual medical characteristics. Nevertheless, while variation by medical characteristics can be medically justified, the same cannot be said for geographic variation. Our finding that density of oncology hospitals predicts chemotherapy use suggests that provider supply is positively correlated with geographic variation.},

Yet, when it comes to clinical trials we nearly always randomize but we rarely analyse the way we randomize and Fisher himself was no exception. Two controversies involving Fisher in the 1930s are discussed: one with Neyman concerning additivity and the other with Student concerning randomization. Their relevance today is considered, as is whether randomization inference in clinical trials is dead and whether modelling rules the day, whether minimization is an acceptable procedure and to what extent trialists confuse experiments with surveys. It will be maintained that a number of different possible purposes of clinical trials have been confused because in the case of the general linear model, under strong additivity, they can all be satisfied by a single analysis. More generally, however, this is not the case.},

To develop this theoretical argument, we analyze community-supported agriculture, which has emerged in response to the corporate co-optation of the organic food movement.

	Abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Difference in breast cancer survival by race is a recognized problem among Medicare beneficiaries. OBJECTIVE: To determine if racial disparity in breast cancer survival is primarily attributable to differences in presentation characteristics at diagnosis or subsequent treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Comparison of 7375 black women 65 years and older diagnosed between 1991 to 2005 and 3 sets of 7375 matched white control patients selected from 99,898 white potential controls, using data for 16 US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) sites in the SEER-Medicare database. All patients received follow-up through December 31, 2009, and the black case patients were matched to 3 white control populations on demographics (age, year of diagnosis, and SEER site), presentation (demographics variables plus patient comorbid conditions and tumor characteristics such as stage, size, grade, and estrogen receptor status), and treatment (presentation variables plus details of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 5-Year survival. RESULTS: The absolute difference in 5-year survival (blacks, 55.9\%; whites, 68.8\%) was 12.9\% (95\% CI, 11.5\%-14.5\%; P < .001) in the demographics match. This difference remained unchanged between 1991 and 2005. After matching on presentation characteristics, the absolute difference in 5-year survival was 4.4\% (95\% CI, 2.8\%-5.8\%; P < .001) and was 3.6\% (95\% CI, 2.3\%-4.9\%; P < .001) lower for blacks than for whites matched also on treatment. In the presentation match, fewer blacks received treatment (87.4\% vs 91.8\%; P < .001), time from diagnosis to treatment was longer (29.2 vs 22.8 days; P < .001), use of anthracyclines and taxols was lower (3.7\% vs 5.0\%; P < .001), and breast-conserving surgery without other treatment was more frequent (8.2\% vs 7.3\%; P = .04). Nevertheless, differences in survival associated with treatment differences accounted for only 0.81\% of the 12.9\% survival difference. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the SEER-Medicare database, differences in breast cancer survival between black and white women did not substantially change among women diagnosed between 1991 and 2005. These differences in survival appear primarily related to presentation characteristics at diagnosis rather than treatment differences.},

	Abstract = {Attacking the common view that whiteness is a meaningless category of identity, Lipsitz shows that public policy and private prejudice insure that whites wind up on top of the social hierarchy. <P>Passionately and clearly written, this wide-ranging book probes into the social and material rewards that accrue to "the possessive investment in whiteness." Lipsitz sums up the ways that public policy has virtually excluded communities of color from everything that American society defines as desirable: first-rate education, decent housing, asset accumulation, political power, social status, satisfying work, and even the power to shape and narrate their own history. White supremacy is no thing of the past, no fringe movement. It is a pervasive and pernicious system that restricts the political and cultural agency of African-Americans, Asian-Americans and Latinos every day. Unearned and unacknowledged, race-based advantages, not greater merit or a superior work ethic, account for white privilege. <P>Lipsitz's ultimate point is not to condemn all white people as racists but to challenge everyone to begin a principled examination of personal actions and political commitments. Exposing the system of unfairness is not enough. People of all groups-but especially white people because they benefit from that system-have to work toward eradicating the rewards of whiteness.},

@article{Mund:78,
	Abstract = {In empirical analysis of data consisting of repeated
observations on economic units (time series on a cross
section) it is often assumed that the coefficients of the
quantitative variables (slopes) are the same, whereas the
coefficients of the qualitative variables (intercepts or
effects) vary over units or periods.This is the
constant-slope variable-intercept framework. In such an
analysis an explicit account should be taken of the
statistical dependence that exists between the quantitative
variables and the effects. It is shown that when this is
done, the random effect approach and the fixed effect
approach yield the same estimate for the slopes, the
\{"\}within\{"\} estimate. Any matrix combination of the
\{"\}within\{"\} and \{"\}between\{"\} estimates is generally
biased. When the \{"\}within\{"\} estimate is subject to a
relatively large error a minimum mean square error can be
applied, as is generally done in regression analysis. Such
an estimator is developed here from a somewhat different
point of departure.},

	Abstract = {Three main lines of arguments are presented as a defense
of randomization in experimental design. The first concerns
the computational advantages of randomizing when a
well-defined underlying theoretical model is not available,
as is often the case in much experimentation in the medical
and social sciences. The high desirability, even for the
most dedicated Bayesians, of physical randomization in some
special cases is stressed. The second line of argument
concerns communication of methodology and results,
especially in terms of concerns about bias. The third line
of argument concerns the use of randomization to guarantee
causal inferences, whether the inference consists of the
identification of a prima facie or a genuine cause. In
addition, the relation of randomization to measures of
complexity and the possibility of accepting only random
procedures that produce complex results are discussed.},

@article{Rosenbaum1984c,
	Abstract = {In observational studies, the distribution of treatment assignments is unknown, and therefore randomization tests are not generally applicable. However, permutation tests that condition on sample information about the treatment assignment mechanism can be applicable in observational studies, provided treatment assignment is strongly ignorable. These tests use the conditional distribution of the treatment assignments given a sufficient statistic for the unknown parameter of the propensity score. Several tests that are commonly used in observational studies are particular instances of this general procedure. Moreover, conditional permutation tests and covariance adjustment are closely related, in the sense that the conditional permutation distribution of the covariance adjusted difference leads to the same inferences as the conditional permutation distribution of the unadjusted difference of sample means. A backtrack algorithm is developed to permit efficient calculation of the exact conditional significance level, and two approximations are discussed. A clinical study of treatments for lung cancer is used to illustrate the technique. Conditional permutation tests extend previous large sample results on the propensity score by providing a basis for exact tests and confidence intervals in small observational studies when treatment assignment is strongly ignorable.

@article{Rosenbaum2009b,
	Abstract = {In randomized experiments, it is sometimes important to demonstrate that two treatments do not differ greatly in their effects, or to demonstrate that the treatments have very different effects on one outcome similar effects on another outcome. These "demonstrations" may take the form of rejecting a null hypothesis of inequivalence in an equivalence test, or rejecting a null hypothesis of equal and inequivalent effects on two outcomes. The procedures often express a complex hypothesis in terms of component hypotheses, and combine the component significance levels to test the complex hypothesis. If used in a randomized trial, randomization provides valid significance levels for each component test, and hence also for the combined procedure. In an observational study-that is, in a study of treatments that were not randomly assigned-there is typically concern that significance levels for testing hypotheses about treatment effects may be distorted by failure to control for some unobserved pretreatment covariate. This concern is raised in the evaluation of virtually all observational studies. The possible impact of such an unobserved covariate is clarified and displayed by a sensitivity analysis that, for various possible magnitudes of potential bias. yields a corresponding interval of possible significance levels. Some observational studies are sensitive to very small unobserved biases, whereas others are insensitive to large biases. Here, existing sensitivity analyses for component hypotheses are used to generate sensitivity analyses for complex hypotheses tested by combining component significance levels. We apply the procedure to our study of the timing of discharges of premature babies from neonatal intensive care units, focusing on the possible impact of delayed discharge on use of unplanned medical care after discharge.},

and prognostic models in estimating treatment effects from
observational studies. One issue investigated was the
effect of estimating the propensity score on estimators of
treatment effect. It was found that estimating the
propensity score introduced no additional bias. A second
question addressed comparisons of the propensity score and
prognostic approach when a confounder is omitted. The
results indicate that biases due to omitted covariates are
large and of the same magnitude. Third, misspecifications
of the propensity score were compared to misspecified
response models. Here it was found that estimators obtained
from incorrect response models had much larger biases than
estimators from incorrectly estimated propensity scores. In
all cases there were two types of models, one involving a
continuous and one a binary response. Least squares
estimators for the continuous response were compared to
stratified mean differences between treatment groups. For
the binary response maximum likelihood estimators of the
odds ratio were compared to Mantel-Haenszel estimators. In
both cases the strata were based on the quintiles of the
true and estimated propensity scores.},

Extension of Goffman's (1974) frame analytic perspective provides the conceptual/theoretical framework; field research on two religious movements, the peace movement, and several neighborhood movements provide the primary empirical base. Four frame alignment processes are identified and elaborated: frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension, and frame transformation. The basic underlying premise is that frame alignment, of one variety or another, is a necessary condition for participation, whatever its nature or intensity, and that it is typically an interactional and ongoing accomplishment. The paper concludes with an elaboration of several sets of theoretical and research implications.},

	Abstract = {This book shows how ordinary Americans imagine their communities and the extent to which their communities' boundaries determine who they believe should benefit from the government's resources via redistributive policies. By contributing extensive empirical analyses to a largely theoretical discussion, it highlights the subjective nature of communities while confronting the elusive task of pinning down "pictures in people's heads." A deeper understanding of people's definitions of their communities and how they affect feelings of duties and obligations provides a new lens through which to look at diverse societies and the potential for both civic solidarity and humanitarian aid. This book analyzes three different types of communities and more than eight national surveys. Wong finds that the decision to help only those within certain borders and ignore the needs of those outside rests, to a certain extent, on whether and how people translate their sense of community into obligations.

Book Description
Based on analysis of three types of communities and eight national surveys, this book examines how ordinary Americans imagine their communities. Wong concludes that people's definition of their community and delineation of its boundaries shape their views on governmental redistributive policies.

of Quality Technology<br> <br> Since the previous edition
of this popular guide to the most commonly used statistical
distributions was published in 1993, statistical methods
have found many new applications in science, medicine,
engineering, business/finance, and the social sciences. To
keep pace with these developments and to highlight the
growing influence of statistical software and data
management techniques, this new edition is now thoroughly
updated and revised. Through clear, concise, easy-to-follow
presentations, the authors discuss the key facts and
formulas for 40 major probability distributions, fine-tune
all existing material, and continue to offer ready access
to vital information gleaned from hard-to-find places
across the literature. Highly useful both as an
introduction to basic principles and as a quick reference
guide, Statistical Distributions, Third Edition:<br> *
Presents the 40 distributions in alphabetical order<br> *
Provides all key formulas for each distribution<br> * Adds
a new chapter on the Empirical Distribution Function<br> *
Expands the Weibull Distribution to cover the 3 and 5
parameter versions<br> * Incorporates diagrams and tables
illustrating the characteristics of each distribution<br> *
Discusses the types of application for which distributions
are used<br> * Features references to relevant software

@article{Lehm:1990,
	Abstract = {Since Fisher's formulation in 1922 of a framework for
theoretical statistics, statistical theory has been
concerned primarily with the derivation and properties of
suitable statistical procedures on the basis of an assumed
statistical model (including sensitivity to deviations from
this model). Until relatively recently, the theory has paid
little attention to the question of how such a model should
be chosen. In the present paper, we consider first what
Fisher and Neyman had to say about this problem and in
Section 2 survey some contributions statistical theory has
made to it. In Section 3 we study a distinction between two
types of models (empirical and explanatory) which has been
discussed by Neyman, Box, and others. A concluding section
considers some lines of further work.},

@article{Rosenbaum2005,
	Abstract = {A new test is proposed comparing two multivariate distributions by using distances between observations. Unlike earlier tests using interpoint distances, the new test statistic has a known exact distribution and is exactly distribution free. The interpoint distances are used to construct an optimal non-bipartite matching, i.e. a matching of the observations into disjoint pairs to minimize the total distance within pairs.The cross-match statistic is the number of pairs containing one observation from the first distribution and one from the second. Distributions that are very different will exhibit few cross-matches.When comparing two discrete distributions with finite support, the test is consistent against all alternatives. The test is applied to a study of brain activation measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging during two linguistic tasks, comparing brains that are impaired by arteriovenous abnormalities with normal controls. A second exact distribution-free test is also discussed: it ranks the pairs and sums the ranks of the cross-matched pairs.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for
linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory. The
procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro
implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the
strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of
overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies
directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The
impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and
information, mobility opportunity, and community
organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive
power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly,
with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to
small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends
itself to discussion of relations between groups and to
analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined
in terms of primary groups.},

	Abstract = {CONTEXT: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) implemented duty hour regulations for physicians-in-training throughout the United States on July 1, 2003. The association of duty hour reform with mortality among patients in teaching hospitals nationally has not been well established. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the change in duty hour regulations was associated with relative changes in mortality among Medicare patients in hospitals of different teaching intensity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: An observational study of all unique Medicare patients (N = 8 529 595) admitted to short-term, acute-care, general US nonfederal hospitals (N = 3321) using interrupted time series analysis with data from July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2005. All Medicare patients had principal diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, or stroke or a diagnosis related group classification of general, orthopedic, or vascular surgery. Logistic regression was used to examine the change in mortality for patients in more vs less teaching-intensive hospitals before (academic years 2000-2003) and after (academic years 2003-2005) duty hour reform, adjusting for patient comorbidities, common time trends, and hospital site. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-location mortality within 30 days of hospital admission. RESULTS: In medical and surgical patients, no significant relative increases or decreases in the odds of mortality for more vs less teaching-intensive hospitals were observed in either postreform year 1 (combined medical conditions group: odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.07; and combined surgical categories group: OR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.12) or postreform year 2 (combined medical conditions group: OR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.99-1.08; and combined surgical categories group: OR, 1.01; 95\% CI, 0.95-1.08) compared with the prereform years. The only condition for which there was a relative increase in mortality in more teaching-intensive hospitals postreform was stroke, but this association preceded the onset of duty hour reform. Compared with nonteaching hospitals, the most teaching-intensive hospitals had an absolute change in mortality from prereform year 1 to postreform year 2 of 0.42 percentage points (4.4\% relative increase) for patients in the combined medical conditions group and 0.05 percentage points (2.3\% relative increase) for patients in the combined surgical categories group, neither of which were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The ACGME duty hour reform was not associated with either significant worsening or improvement in mortality for Medicare patients in the first 2 years after implementation.},

	Abstract = {When subjects are measured twice, once at each of two symmetrical locations or times, stability of responses in the absence of treatment within subjects, together with comparability of untreated responses between subjects, is often viewed as supporting a conclusion that differences between treated and control responses reflect effects actually caused by the treatment. The degree to which this intuitive argument is formally correct is explored in several related models: a multivariate Normal model, a nonparametric model defined by symmetries, an analogous randomized experiment, and a sensitivity analysis model for observational studies in which treatments are not randomly assigned to subjects, nor to locations within subjects. Card and Kreuger's study of the employment effects of the minimum wage is used to illustrate the methods },

	Abstract = {This article examines some problems of significance testing for one-sided hypotheses of the form H0: \{\^{I}\}¸ \{\^{a}\} \{\^{I}\}¸0 versus H\_1: $\theta$> $\theta$\_0 , where \{\^{I}\}¸ is the parameter of interest. In the usual setting, let x be the observed data and let T(X) be a test statistic such that the family of distributions of T(X) is stochastically increasing in \{\^{I}\}¸. Define Cx as \{X: T(X) - T(x) \{\^{a}\} 0\}. The p value is p(x) = $\backslash$sup\_\{$\theta$$\backslash$leq $\theta$\_0\} $\backslash$Pr(X $\backslash$in C\_x $\backslash$mid $\theta$) . In the presence of a nuisance parameter \{\^{I}\}·, there may not exist a nontrivial Cx with a p value independent of \{\^{I}\}·. We consider tests based on generalized extreme regions of the form Cx(\{\^{I}\}¸, \{\^{I}\}·) = \{X: T(X; x, \{\^{I}\}¸, \{\^{I}\}·) \{\^{a}\} T(x; x, \{\^{I}\}¸, \{\^{I}\}·)\}, and conditions on T(X, x, \{\^{I}\}¸, \{\^{I}\}·) are given such that the p value p(x) = $\backslash$sup\_\{$\theta$$\backslash$leq $\theta$\_0\} Pr(X $\backslash$in C\_x $\backslash$mid $\theta$) is free of the nuisance parameter \{\^{I}\}·, where T is stochastically increasing in \{\^{I}\}¸. We provide a solution to the problem of testing hypotheses about the differences in means of two independent exponential distributions, a problem for which the fixed-level testing approach has not produced a nontrivial solution except in a special case. We also provide an exact solution to the Behrens-Fisher problem. The p value for the Behrens-Fisher problem turns out to be numerically (but not logically) the same as Jeffreys's Bayesian solution and the Behrens-Fisher fiducial solution. Our approach of testing on the basis of p values is especially useful in multiparameter problems where nontrivial tests with a fixed level of significance are difficult or impossible to obtain.},

	Abstract = {The propensity score is the conditional probability of assignment to a particular treatment given a vector of observed covariates. Previous theoretical arguments have shown that subclassification on the propensity score will balance all observed covariates. Subclassification on an estimated propensity score is illustrated, using observational data on treatments for coronary artery disease. Five subclasses defined by the estimated propensity score are constructed that balance 74 covariates, and thereby provide estimates of treatment effects using direct adjustment. These subclasses are applied within subpopulations, and model-based adjustments are then used to provide estimates of treatment effects within these subpopulations. Two appendixes address theoretical issues related to the application: the effectiveness of subclassification on the propensity score in removing bias, and balancing properties of propensity scores with incomplete data.

	Abstract = {Sufficiency has long been regarded as the primary reduction procedure to simplify a statistical model, and the assessment of the procedure involves an implicit global repeated sampling principle. By contrast, conditional procedures are almost as old and yet appear only occasionally in the central statistical literature. Recent likelihood theory examines the form of a general large sample statistical model and finds that certain natural conditional procedures provide, in wide generality, the definitive reduction from the initial variable to a variable of the same dimension as the parameter, a variable that can be viewed as directly measuring the parameter. We begin with a discussion of two intriguing examples from the literature that compare conditional and global inference methods, and come quite extraordinarily to opposite assessments concerning the appropriateness and validity of the two approaches. We then take two simple normal examples, with and without known scaling, and progressively replace the restrictive normal location assumption by more general distributional assumptions. We find that sufficiency typically becomes inapplicable and that conditional procedures from large sample likelihood theory produce the definitive reduction for the analysis. We then examine the vector parameter case and find that the elimination of nuisance parameters requires a marginalization step, not the commonly proffered conditional calculation that is based on exponential model structure. Some general conditioning and modelling criteria are then introduced. This is followed by a survey of common ancillary examples, which are then assessed for conformity to the criteria. In turn, this leads to a discussion of the place for the global repeated sampling principle in statistical inference. It is argued that the principle in conjunction with various optimality criteria has been a primary factor in the long-standing attachment to the sufficiency approach and in the related neglect of the conditioning procedures based directly on available evidence.},

	Abstract = {Statistical analysis requires a probability model: commonly, a model for the dependence of outcomes Y on confounders X and a potentially causal variable Z. When the goal of the analysis is to infer Z's effects on Y , this requirement introduces an element of circularity: in order to decide how Z affects Y , the analyst first determines, speculatively, the manner of Y 's dependence on Z and other variables. This paper takes a statistical perspective that avoids such circles, permitting analysis of Z's effects on Y even as the statistician remains entirely agnostic about the conditional distribution of Y given X and Z, or perhaps even denies that such a distribution exists. Our assumptions instead pertain to the conditional distribution Z|X, and the role of speculation in settling them is reduced by the use of such techniques as propensity scores, poststratification, testing for overt bias before accepting a poststratification, and optimal full matching. Such beginnings pave the way for ``randomization inference'', an approach which, despite a long history in the analysis of designed experiments, is relatively new to political science and to other fields in which experimental data are rarely available. The approach applies to both experiments and observational studies. We illustrate this by applying it to analyze A. Gerber and D. Green's New Haven Vote 98 campaign. Conceived as both a get-out-the-vote campaign and a field experiment in political participation, the campaign as it turned out was in some ways more similar to an observational study than to a randomized experiment. Our analysis uses the strengths of the design of their study while adjusting for irregularities ignored by the original analysis. We estimate the number of voters who would not have voted had the campaign not prompted them to --- that is, the total number of votes attributable to the interventions of the campaigners. Both our statistical inferences about these attributable effects and the stratification and matching that precede them rely on quite recent developments from statistics; our matching, in particular, has novel features of potentially wide applicability. Our broad findings resemble those of the original analysis by Gerber and Green (2000), although in the small, the method offers additional information as to the campaign's effects upon interestingly different subgroups, such as older voters or those who have not voted in a previous election. },

	Abstract = {Statisticians have contributed enormously to the
conceptualization, development, and success of case-control
methods for the study of disease causation and prevention.
This article reviews the major developments. It starts with
Cornfield's demonstration of odds ratio invariance under
cohort versus case-control sampling, proceeds through the
still-popular Mantel-Haenszel procedure and its extensions
for dependent data, and highlights (conditional) likelihood
methods for relative risk regression. Recent work on nested
case-control, case-cohort, and two-stage case-control
designs demonstrates the continuing impact of statistical
thinking on epidemiology. The influence of R. A. Fisher's
work on these developments is mentioned wherever possible.
His objections to the drawing of causal conclusions from
observational data on cigarette smoking and lung cancer are
used to introduce the problems of measurement error and
confounding bias. The resolution of such difficulties,
whether by further development and implementation of
randomized intervention trials or by causal analysis of
observational data using graphical models containing latent
variables, will challenge future generations of
statisticians.},

	Abstract = {The assignment algorithm is an old, well-known, widely implemented, fast, combinatorial algorithm for optimal matching in a bipartite graph. This note proposes a method for using the assignment algorithm to solve the problem of optimal matching with a variable number of controls, in which there is a choice not only of who to select as a control for each treated subject, but also of how many controls to have for each treated subject. The strategy uses multiple copies of treated subjects and sinks with zero cost to absorb extra controls. Also, it is shown that an optimal matching with variable numbers of controls cannot be obtained by starting with an optimal pair matching and adding the closest additional controls. An example involving mortality after surgery in Pennsylvania hospitals is used to illustrate the method.

The provision of that information is governed by principles of democratic transparency. Democratic transparency both extends and critiques current enthusiasms about transparency. It urges us to conceptualize information politically, as a resource to turn the behavior of large organizations in socially beneficial ways. Transparency efforts have targets, and we should think of those targets as large organizations: public and civic, but especially private and corporate. Democratic transparency consists of four principles. First, information about the operations and actions of large organizations that affect citizens' interests should be rich, deep, and readily available to the public. Second, the amount of available information should be proportionate to the extent to which those organizations jeopardize citizens' interests. Third, information should be organized and provided in ways that are accessible to individuals and groups that use that information. Finally, the social, political, and economic structures of society should be organized in ways that allow individuals and groups to take action based on Infotopia's public disclosures.},

Can descriptive comparisons meaningfully be paired with significance tests? If so, should there be several such tests, one for each pretreatment variable, or should there be a single, omnibus test? Could such a test be engineered to give easily computed p-values that are reliable in samples of moderate size, or would simulation be needed for reliable calibration? What new concerns are introduced by random assignment of clusters? Which tests of balance would be optimal? To address these questions, Fisher's randomization inference is applied to the question of balance. Its application suggests the reversal of published conclusions about two studies, one clinical and the other a field experiment in political participation.},

	Abstract = {CONTEXT: Limitations in duty hours for physicians-in-training in the United States were established by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and implemented on July 1, 2003. The association of these changes with mortality among hospitalized patients has not been well established. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the change in duty hour regulations was associated with relative changes in mortality in hospitals of different teaching intensity within the US Veterans Affairs (VA) system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: An observational study of all unique patients (N = 318 636) admitted to acute-care VA hospitals (N = 131) using interrupted time series analysis with data from July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2005. All patients had principal diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, or stroke or a diagnosis related group classification of general, orthopedic, or vascular surgery. Logistic regression was used to examine the change in mortality for patients in more vs less teaching-intensive hospitals before (academic years 2000-2003) and after (academic years 2003-2005) duty hour reform, adjusting for patient comorbidities, common time trends, and hospital site. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-location mortality within 30 days of hospital admission. RESULTS: In postreform year 1, no significant relative changes in mortality were observed for either medical or surgical patients. In postreform year 2, the odds of mortality decreased significantly in more teaching-intensive hospitals for medical patients only. Comparing a hospital having a resident-to-bed ratio of 1 with a hospital having a resident-to-bed ratio of 0, the odds of mortality were reduced for patients with AMI (odds ratio [OR], 0.48; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.71), for the 4 medical conditions together (OR, 0.74; 95\% CI, 0.61-0.89), and for the 3 medical conditions excluding AMI (OR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.63-0.98). Compared with hospitals in the 25th percentile of teaching intensity, there was an absolute improvement in mortality from prereform year 1 to postreform year 2 of 0.70 percentage points (11.1\% relative decrease) and 0.88 percentage points (13.9\% relative decrease) in hospitals in the 75th and 90th percentile of teaching intensity, respectively, for the combined medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The ACGME duty hour reform was associated with significant relative improvement in mortality for patients with 4 common medical conditions in more teaching-intensive VA hospitals in postreform year 2. No associations were identified for surgical patients.},

The NIMB form of politics isnot a social movement of politically consciousconsumers, yet it is still a political activity inwhich consumers participate in the formation of theindustry through a process of ``reflexive consumption.''An analysis of producer-consumer discourse on milkcartons reveals the nature of this political formation.},

	Abstract = {A comparison and evaluation is made of recent proposals for multivariate matched sampling in observational studies, where the following three questions are answered: (1) Algorithms: In current statistical practice, matched samples are formed using "nearest available" matching, a greedy algorithm. Greedy matching does not minimize the total distance within matched pairs, though good algorithms exist for optimal matching that do minimize the total distance. How much better is optimal matching than greedy matching? We find that optimal matching is sometimes noticeably better than greedy matching in the sense of producing closely matched pairs, sometimes only marginally better, but it is no better than greedy matching in the sense of producing balanced matched samples. (2) Structures: In common practice, treated units are matched to one control, called pair matching or 1-1 matching, or treated units are matched to two controls, called 1-2 matching, and so on. It is known, however, that the optimal structure is a full matching in which a treated unit may have one or more controls or a control may have one or more treated units. Optimal 1 - k matching is compared to optimal full matching, finding that optimal full matching is often much better. (3) Distances: Matching involves defining a distance between covariate vectors, and several such distances exist. Three recent proposals are compared. Practical advice is summarized in a final section.},

	Abstract = {The paper examines the aestheticisation of food in the context of 'eating out' and distinguishes two main aesthetic types: first, an 'aesthetic of entertainment' in which food quality is secondary to the restaurant experience; second, a 'gastronomic aesthetic' in which the quality of food, notably seasonality and freshness, is seen as primary. Having distinguished the two types, the paper then investigates the second - the gastronomic aesthetic - through the case study of Slow Food in Tuscany. The Slow Food movement seeks to heighten the aesthetic appreciation of typical products and works mainly through local groups and typical restaurants. Through the in-depth analysis of one such restaurant, the paper outlines three main strands in the gastronomic aesthetic: a practical aesthetics of restaurant organisation; an aesthetical-ethic of typical foods; and, an aesthetic of 'connectedness' or 'embeddedness' in which the food is seen as a reflection of surrounding socio-economic and ecological relationships. The paper concludes by drawing out the implications of the study of aesthetics for rural sociology.},

First, pairs must not only balance covariates, but also must differ markedly in dose. Second, any two subjects may be paired, so that the matching is nonbipartite, and different algorithms are required. Finally, a propensity score with doses must be used in place of the conventional propensity score. We illustrate multivariate matching with doses using pilot data from a media campaign against drug abuse. The media campaign is intended to change attitudes and intentions related to illegal drugs, and the evaluation compares stated intentions among ostensibly comparable teens who reported markedly different exposures to the media campaign.

briefly commented on how to make a randomization test on
some data generated by a Darwin experiment. Two variants of
this randomization test are discussed in this article. The
variant that is discussed in Section 4 may be regarded as
the forerunner of all nonparametric tests. The original
variant of the test is discussed in Section 6. The author
concludes that the Fisher randomization test is not

In this article, we borrow from Parsons and Shils to offer a conceptualization of context. This conceptualization, and a recognition of both Lippmann's pseduoenvironments and the statistical Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, lead us to a new measurement strategy. We propose a map-based measure to capture how ordinary people use information about their environments to make decisions about politics. Respondents draw their contexts on maps--deciding the boundaries of their relevant environments--and describe their perceptions of hte demographic make-up of these contexts. The evidence is clear: `pictures in our heads' do not resemble governmental administrative units in shape or content. By `bringing the person back in' to the measurement of context, we are able to marry psychological theories of information processing with sociological theories of racial threat.},

These matched samples displayed little to no differences across hospitals in common patient characteristics yet found large and statistically significant hospital variation in mortality, complications, failure-to-rescue, readmissions, length of stay, ICU days, cost, and surgical procedure length. Similar patients at different hospitals had substantially different outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The template-matched sample can produce fair, directly standardized audits that evaluate hospitals on patients with similar characteristics, thereby making benchmarking more believable. Through examining matched samples of individual patients, administrators can better detect poor performance at their hospitals and better understand why these problems are occurring.},

@misc{Rosenbaum2007d,
	Abstract = {In a randomized experiment comparing two treatments, there is interference between units if applying the treatment to one unit may affect other units. Interference implies that treatment effects are not comparisons of two potential responses that a unit may exhibit, one under treatment and the other under control, but instead are inherently more complex. Interference is common in social settings where people communicate, compete, or spread disease; in studies that treat one part of an organism using a symmetrical part as control; in studies that apply different treatments to the same organism at different times; and in many other situations. Available statistical tools are limited. For instance, Fisher's sharp null hypothesis of no treatment effect implicitly entails no interference, and so his randomization test may be used to test no effect, but conventional ways of inverting the test to obtain confidence intervals, say for an additive effect, are not applicable with interference. Another commonly used approach assumes that interference is of a simple parametric form confined to units that are near one another in time or space; this is useful when applicable but is of little use when interference may be widespread and of uncertain form. Exact, nonparametric methods are developed for inverting randomization tests to obtain confidence intervals for magnitudes of effect assuming nothing at all about the structure of the interference between units. The limitations of these methods are discussed. To illustrate the general approach, two simple methods and two simple empirical examples are discussed. Extension to randomization based covariance adjustment is briefly described.},

Here, the form of an 'optimal' subclassification is determined, i.e. a subclassi- fication which makes the treated and control subjects in the same subclass as similar as possible. This optimal form is simple, intuitive and quite practical, though it is rarely used. The optimal form has several consequences. First, it suggests that theoretical investigations may assume that observational studies have this form, for if they do not they may be changed to this form without a loss, and often with a gain. Second, in searching for an optimal subclassification, the search may be confined to subclassifications of this form, for one is sure to be optimal. Finally, it is shown that finding an optimal subclassification of this form may often be reduced to finding the minimum cost flow in a certain network, i.e. to a standard combinatorial optimization problem for which good algorithms exist.},

	Abstract = {The \{"\}numerical method\{"\} in medicine goes back to Pierre
Louis' 1835 study of pneumonia and John Snow's 1855 book on
the epidemiology of cholera. Snow took advantage of natural
experiments and used convergent lines of evidence to
demonstrate that cholera is a waterborne infectious
disease. More recently, investigators in the social and
life sciences have used statistical models and significance
tests to deduce cause-and-effect relationships from
patterns of association; an early example is Yule's 1899
study on the causes of poverty. In my view, this modeling
enterprise has not been successful. Investigators tend to
neglect the difficulties in establishing causal relations,
and the mathematical complexities obscure rather than
clarify the assumptions on which the analysis is based.
Formal statistical inference is, by its nature,
conditional. If maintained hypotheses A, B, C,... hold,
then H can be tested against the data. However, if A, B,
C,... remain in doubt, so must inferences about H. Careful
scrutiny of maintained hypotheses should therefore be a
critical part of empirical work-a principle honored more
often in the breach than the observance. Snow's work on
cholera will be contrasted with modern studies that depend
on statistical models and tests of significance. The
examples may help to clarify the limits of current
statistical techniques for making causal inferences from
patterns of association.},

	Abstract = {Finite population sampling is perhaps the only area of statistics in which the primary mode of analysis is based on the randomization distribution, rather than on statistical models for the measured variables. This article reviews the debate between design-based and model-based inference. The basic features of the two approaches are illustrated using the case of inference about the mean from stratified random samples. Strengths and weakness of design-based and model-based inference for surveys are discussed. It is suggested that models that take into account the sample design and make weak parametric assumptions can produce reliable and efficient inferences in surveys settings. These ideas are illustrated using the problem of inference from unequal probability samples. A model-based regression analysis that leads to a combination of design-based and model-based weighting is described. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	Abstract = {A predictor variable or dose that is measured with substantial error may possess an error-free milestone, such that it is known with negligible error whether the value of the variable is to the left or right of the milestone. Such a milestone provides a basis for estimating a linear relationship between the true but unknown value of the error-free predictor and an outcome, because the milestone creates a strong and valid instrumental variable. The inferences are nonparametric and robust, and in the simplest cases, they are exact and distribution free. We also consider multiple milestones for a single predictor and milestones for several predictors whose partial slopes are estimated simultaneously. Examples are drawn from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, in which a BA degree acts as a milestone for sixteen years of education, and the binary indicator of military service acts as a milestone for years of service.},

In a cohort study, matching or stratifying treated and control subjects on a single variable, the propensity score, tends to balance all of the observed covariates; however, unlike random assignment of treatments, the propensity score may not also balance unobserved covariates. The authors review the uses and limitations of propensity scores and provide a brief outline of associated statistical theory. They also present a new result of using propensity scores in case-cohort studies.Am J Epidemiol 1999; 150: 327-33.},

	Abstract = {Our first purpose was to determine whether, in the context of a group-randomized trial (GRT) with Gaussian errors, permutation or mixed-model regression methods fare better in the presence of measurable confounding in terms of their Monte Carlo type I error rates and power. Our results indicate that given a proper randomization, the type I error rate is similar for both methods, whether unadjusted or adjusted, even in small studies. However, our results also show that should the investigator face the unfortunate circumstance in which modest confounding exists in the only realization available, the unadjusted analysis risks a type I error; in this regard, there was little to distinguish the two methods. Finally, our results show that power is similar for the two methods and, not surprisingly, better for the adjusted tests.Our second purpose was to examine the relative performance of permutation and mixed-model regression methods in the context of a GRT when the normality assumptions underlying the mixed model are violated. Published studies have examined the impact of violation of this assumption at the member level only. Our findings indicate that both methods perform well when the assumption is violated so long as the ICC is very small and the design is balanced at the group level. However, at ICC?0.01, the permutation test carries the nominal type I error rate while the model-based test is conservative and so less powerful. Binomial group- and member-level errors did not otherwise change the relative performance of the two methods with regard to confounding.},

@misc{Rosenbaum2009,
	Abstract = {In randomized experiments, it is sometimes important to demonstrate that two treatments do not differ greatly in their effects, or to demonstrate that the treatments have very different effects on one outcome but similar effects on another outcome. These ``demonstrations'' may take the form of rejecting a null hypothesis of inequivalence in an equivalence test, or rejecting a null hypothesis of equal and inequivalent effects on two outcomes. The procedures often express a complex hypothesis in terms of component hypotheses, and combine the component significance levels to test the complex hypothesis. If used in a randomized trial, randomization provides valid significance levels for each component test, and hence also for the combined procedure. In an observational study---that is, in a study of treatments that were not randomly assigned---there is typically concern that significance levels for testing hypotheses about treatment effects may be distorted by failure to control for some unobserved pretreatment covariate. This concern is raised in the evaluation of virtually all observational studies. The possible impact of such an unobserved covariate is clarified and displayed by a sensitivity analysis that, for various possible magnitudes of potential bias, yields a corresponding interval of possible significance levels. Some observational studies are sensitive to very small unobserved biases, whereas others are insensitive to large biases. Here, existing sensitivity analyses for component hypotheses are used to generate sensitivity analyses for complex hypotheses tested by combining component significance levels. We apply the procedure to our study of the timing of discharges of premature babies from neonatal intensive care units, focusing on the possible impact of delayed discharge on use of unplanned medical care after discharge.},

	Abstract = {An experimental unit is an opportunity to randomly apply or withhold a treatment. There is interference between units if the application of the treatment to one unit may also affect other units. In cognitive neuroscience, a common form of experiment presents a sequence of stimuli or requests for cognitive activity at random to each experimental subject and measures biological aspects of brain activity that follow these requests. Each subject is then many experimental units, and interference between units within an experimental subject is likely, in part because the stimuli follow one another quickly and in part because human subjects learn or become experienced or primed or bored as the experiment proceeds. We use a recent fMRI experiment concerned with the inhibition of motor activity to illustrate and further develop recently proposed methodology for inference in the presence of interference. A simulation evaluates the power of competing procedures.},

The likelihood function and likelihood ratios have clear intuitive meanings that make it easy for students to grasp the important concepts. Modern computing technology has made it possible to use these methods over a wide range of practical applications. However, many mathematical statistics textbooks, particularly those at the Senior/Masters level, do not give this important topic coverage commensurate with its place in the world of modern applications. Similarly, in nonlinear estimation problems, standard practice (as reflected by procedures available in the popular commercial statistical packages) has been slow to recognize the advantages of likelihood-based confidence regions/intervals over the commonly use "normal-theory" regions/intervals based on the asymptotic distribution of the "Wald statistic." In this note we outline our approach for presenting, to students, confidence regions/intervals based on ML estimation.},

	Abstract = {Huber's m-estimates use an estimating equation in which observations are permitted a controlled level of influence. The family of m-estimates includes least squares and maximum likelihood, but typical applications give extreme observations limited weight. Maritz proposed methods of exact and approximate permutation inference for m-tests, confidence intervals, and estimators, which can be derived from random assignment of paired subjects to treatment or control. In contrast, in observational studies, where treatments are not randomly assigned, subjects matched for observed covariates may differ in terms of unobserved covariates, so differing outcomes may not be treatment effects. In observational studies, a method of sensitivity analysis is developed for m-tests, m-intervals, and m-estimates: it shows the extent to which inferences would be altered by biases of various magnitudes due to nonrandom treatment assignment. The method is developed for both matched pairs, with one treated subject matched to one control, and for matched sets, with one treated subject matched to one or more controls. The method is illustrated using two studies: (i) a paired study of damage to DNA from exposure to chromium and nickel and (ii) a study with one or two matched controls comparing side effects of two drug regimes to treat tuberculosis. The approach yields sensitivity analyses for: (i) m-tests with Huber's weight function and other robust weight functions, (ii) the permutational t-test which uses the observations directly, and (iii) various other procedures such as the sign test, Noether's test, and the permutation distribution of the efficient score test for a location family of distributions. Permutation inference with covariance adjustment is briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {In the past two decades, striking examples of allegedly inferior likelihood ratio tests (LRT) have appeared in the statistical literature. These examples, which arise in multiparameter hypothesis testing problems, have several common features. In each case the null hypothesis is composite, the size $\alpha$ LRT is not similar and hence biased, and competing size $\alpha$ tests can be constructed that are less biased, or even unbiased, and that dominate the LRT in the sense of being everywhere more powerful. It is therefore asserted that in these examples and, by implication, many other testing problems, the LR criterion produces "inferior," "deficient," "undesirable," or "flawed" statistical procedures. This message, which appears to be proliferating, is wrong. In each example it is the allegedly superior test that is flawed, not the LRT. At worst, the "superior" tests provide unwarranted and inappropriate inferences and have been deemed scientifically unacceptable by applied statisticians. This reinforces the well-documented but oft-neglected fact that the Neyman-Pearson theory desideratum of a more (or most) powerful size $\alpha$ test may be scientifically inappropriate; the same is true for the criteria of unbiasedness and $\alpha$-admissibility. Although the LR criterion is not infallible, we believe that it remains a generally reasonable first option for non-Bayesian parametric hypothesis-testing problems.},

@article{Rosenbaum1999,
	Abstract = {In a randomized experiment, the investigator creates a clear and relatively unambiguous comparison of treatment groups by exerting tight control over the assignment of treatments to experimental subjects, ensuring that comparable subjects receive alternative treatments. In an observational study, the investigator lacks control of treatment assignments and must seek a clear comparison in other ways. Care in the choice of circumstances in which the study is conducted can greatly influence the quality of the evidence about treatment effects. This is illustrated in detail using three observational studies that use choice effectively, one each from economics, clinical psychology and epidemiology. Other studies are discussed more briefly to illustrate specific points. The design choices include (i) the choice of research hypothesis, (ii) the choice of treated and control groups, (iii) the explicit use of competing theories, rather than merely null and alternative hypotheses, (iv) the use of internal replication in the form of multiple manipulations of a single dose of treatment, (v) the use of undelivered doses in control groups, (vi) design choices to minimize the need for stability analyses, (vii) the duration of treatment and (viii) the use of natural blocks.

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the medical and financial outcomes associated with surgery in elderly obese patients and to ask if obesity itself influences outcomes above and beyond the effects from comorbidities that are known to be associated with obesity. BACKGROUND: Obesity is a surgical risk factor not present in Medicare's risk adjustment or payment algorithms, as BMI is not collected in administrative claims. METHODS: A total of 2045 severely or morbidly obese patients (BMI >/= 35 kg/m, aged between 65 and 80 years) selected from 15,914 elderly patients in 47 hospitals undergoing hip and knee surgery, colectomy, and thoracotomy were matched to 2 sets of 2045 nonobese patients (BMI = 20-30 kg/m). A "limited match" controlled for age, sex, race, procedure, and hospital. A "complete match" also controlled for 30 additional factors such as diabetes and admission clinical data from chart abstraction. RESULTS: Mean BMI in the obese patients was 40 kg/m compared with 26 kg/m in the nonobese. In the complete match, obese patients displayed increased odds of wound infection: OR (odds ratio) = 1.64 (95\% CI: 1.21, 2.21); renal dysfunction: OR = 2.05 (1.39, 3.05); urinary tract infection: OR = 1.55 (1.24, 1.94); hypotension: OR = 1.38 (1.07, 1.80); respiratory events: OR = 1.44 (1.19, 1.75); 30-day readmission: OR = 1.38 (1.08, 1.77); and a 12\% longer length of stay (8\%, 17\%). Provider costs were 10\% (7\%, 12\%) greater in obese than in nonobese patients, whereas Medicare payments increased only 3\% (2\%, 5\%). Findings were similar in the limited match. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity increases the risks and costs of surgery. Better approaches are needed to reduce these risks. Furthermore, to avoid incentives to underserve this population, Medicare should consider incorporating incremental costs of caring for obese patients into payment policy and include obesity in severity adjustment models.},

	Abstract = {In an effort to detect hidden biases due to failure to control for an unobserved covariate, some observational or nonrandomized studies include two control groups selected to systematically vary the unobserved covariate. Comparisons of the treated group and two control groups must, of course, control for imbalances in observed covariates. Using the three groups, we form pairs optimally matched for observed covariates-that is, we optimally construct from observational data an incomplete block design. The incomplete block design may use all available data, or it may use data selectively to produce a balanced incomplete block design, or it may be the basis for constructing a matched sample when expensive outcome information is to be collected only for sampled individuals. The problem of optimal pair matching with two control groups is shown by a series of transformations to be equivalent to a particular form of optimal nonbipartite matching, a problem for which polynomial time algorithms exist. In our examples, we implement the procedure using a nonbipartite matching algorithm due to Derigs. We illustrate the method with data from an observational study of the employment effects of the minimum wage.},

	Abstract = {As the counterfactual model of causality has increased in popularity, sociologists have returned to matching as a research methodology. In this article, advances over the past two decades in matching estimators are explained, and the practical limitations of matching techniques are emphasized. The authors introduce matching methods by focusing first on ideal scenarios in which stratification and weighting procedures warrant causal inference. Then, they discuss how matching is often undertaken in practice, offering an overview of the most prominent data analysis routines. With four hypothetical examples, they demonstrate how the assumptions behind matching estimators often break down in practice. Even so, the authors argue that matching techniques can be used effectively to strengthen the prosecution of causal questions in sociology. },

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Earlier work demonstrated that ACGME duty hour reform did not adversely affect mortality, with slight improvement noted among specific subgroups. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether resident duty hour reform differentially affected the mortality risk of high severity patients or patients who experienced post-operative complications (failure-to-rescue). DESIGN: Observational study using interrupted time series analysis with data from July 1, 2000 - June 30, 2005. Fixed effects logistic regression was used to examine the change in the odds of mortality or failure-to-rescue (FTR) in more versus less teaching-intensive hospitals before and after duty hour reform. PARTICIPANTS: All unique Medicare patients (n = 8,529,595) admitted to short-term acute care non-federal hospitals and all unique VA patients (n = 318,636 patients) with principal diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, stroke or a DRG classification of general, orthopedic or vascular surgery. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured mortality within 30 days of hospital admission and FTR, measured by death among patients who experienced a surgical complication. The odds of mortality and FTR generally changed at similar rates for higher and lower risk patients in more vs. less teaching intensive hospitals. For example, comparing the mortality risk for the 10\% of Medicare patients with highest risk to the other 90\% of patients in post-reform year 1 for combined medical an OR of 1.01 [95\% CI 0.90, 1.13], for combined surgical an OR of 0.91 [95\% CI 0.80, 1.04], and for FTR an OR of 0.94 [95\% CI 0.80, 1.09]. Findings were similar in year 2 for both Medicare and VA. The two exceptions were a relative increase in mortality for the highest risk medical (OR 1.63 [95\% CI 1.08, 2.46]) and a relative decrease in the high risk surgical patients within VA in post-reform year 1 (OR 0.52 [95\% CI 0.29, 0.96]). CONCLUSIONS: ACGME duty hour reform was not associated with any consistent improvements or worsening in mortality or failure-to-rescue rates for high risk medical or surgical patients.},

The direct transmission model is robust, as it withstands an extensive set of controls.

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We ask whether Medicare's Hospital Compare random effects model correctly assesses acute myocardial infarction (AMI) hospital mortality rates when there is a volume-outcome relationship. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Medicare claims on 208,157 AMI patients admitted in 3,629 acute care hospitals throughout the United States. STUDY DESIGN: We compared average-adjusted mortality using logistic regression with average adjusted mortality based on the Hospital Compare random effects model. We then fit random effects models with the same patient variables as in Medicare's Hospital Compare mortality model but also included terms for hospital Medicare AMI volume and another model that additionally included other hospital characteristics. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Hospital Compare's average adjusted mortality significantly underestimates average observed death rates in small volume hospitals. Placing hospital volume in the Hospital Compare model significantly improved predictions. CONCLUSIONS: The Hospital Compare random effects model underestimates the typically poorer performance of low-volume hospitals. Placing hospital volume in the Hospital Compare model, and possibly other important hospital characteristics, appears indicated when using a random effects model to predict outcomes. Care must be taken to insure the proper method of reporting such models, especially if hospital characteristics are included in the random effects model.},

	Abstract = {"Coming home to eat" [Nabhan, 2002. Coming Home to Eat: The Pleasures and Politics of Local Foods. Norton, New York] has become a clarion call among alternative food movement activists. Most food activist discourse makes a strong connection between the localization of food systems and the promotion of environmental sustainability and social justice. Much of the US academic literature on food systems echoes food activist rhetoric about alternative food systems as built on alternative social norms. New ways of thinking, the ethic of care, desire, realization, and vision become the explanatory factors in the creation of alternative food systems. In these norm-based explanations, the "Local" becomes the context in which this type of action works. In the European food system literature about local "value chains" and alternative food networks, localism becomes a way to maintain rural livelihoods. In both the US and European literatures on localism, the global becomes the universal logic of capitalism and the local the point of resistance to this global logic, a place where "embeddedness" can and does happen. Nevertheless, as other literatures outside of food studies show, the local is often a site of inequality and hegemonic domination. However, rather than declaim the "radical particularism" of localism, it is more productive to question an "unreflexive localism" and to forge localist alliances that pay attention to equality and social justice. The paper explores what that kind of localist politics might look like.},

assignment to a particular treatment given a vector of
observed covariates. Previous theoretical arguments have
shown that subclassification on the propensity score will
balance all observed covariates. Subclassification on an
estimated propensity score is illustrated, using
observational data on treatments for coronary artery
disease. Five subclasses defined by the estimated
propensity score are constructed that balance 74
covariates, and thereby provide estimates of treatment
effects using direct adjustment. These subclasses are
applied within subpopulations, and model-based adjustments
are then used to provide estimates of treatment effects
within these subpopulations. Two appendixes address
theoretical issues related to the application: the
effectiveness of subclassification on the propensity score
in removing bias, and balancing properties of propensity
scores with incomplete data.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Procedure time is a clinically important variable that is often analyzed when studying quality and efficiency. Norms for procedure length have not been reported from Medicare data sets, nor has the influence of patient and hospital characteristics on procedure time been estimated using Medicare data. METHODS: The authors obtained Medicare claims on all patients aged 65-85 years who underwent general surgical and orthopedic surgical procedures in Pennsylvania. Anesthesia procedure time was estimated from anesthesia time units bills supplied from Medicare on 20 common general and orthopedic surgery procedures, and models to determine the influence of hospital and patient characteristics were developed. RESULTS: Of the 77,638 patients, 31,472 had general surgery and 46,166 underwent orthopedic procedures. The median anesthesia time for general surgery was 133 min, and for orthopedic surgery it was 146 min. After adjusting for principal procedure, hospital, and physiologic severity, covariates associated with increased anesthesia time included: multiple procedure on same day + 18.3 min (P < 0.0001); transfer-in + 6.7 min (P = 0.0002); black race + 5.5 (P < 0.0001); coagulation disorders + 4.9 (P = 0.0012); and paraplegia + 4.5 (P = 0.0006). Lower-income black patients had significantly longer procedure times than lower-income white patients (+ 7 min; P < 0.0001). Among the 15 hospitals with the largest black surgical populations, 5 hospitals had statistically significant procedure lengths for black versus white patients, ranging from + 9 to + 16 min. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to variation by patient comorbidities and procedure, anesthesia procedure time varies with hospital, medical history, and sociodemographic characteristics.},

	Abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Difference in breast cancer survival by race is a recognized problem among Medicare beneficiaries. OBJECTIVE: To determine if racial disparity in breast cancer survival is primarily attributable to differences in presentation characteristics at diagnosis or subsequent treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Comparison of 7375 black women 65 years and older diagnosed between 1991 to 2005 and 3 sets of 7375 matched white control patients selected from 99,898 white potential controls, using data for 16 US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) sites in the SEER-Medicare database. All patients received follow-up through December 31, 2009, and the black case patients were matched to 3 white control populations on demographics (age, year of diagnosis, and SEER site), presentation (demographics variables plus patient comorbid conditions and tumor characteristics such as stage, size, grade, and estrogen receptor status), and treatment (presentation variables plus details of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 5-Year survival. RESULTS: The absolute difference in 5-year survival (blacks, 55.9\%; whites, 68.8\%) was 12.9\% (95\% CI, 11.5\%-14.5\%; P < .001) in the demographics match. This difference remained unchanged between 1991 and 2005. After matching on presentation characteristics, the absolute difference in 5-year survival was 4.4\% (95\% CI, 2.8\%-5.8\%; P < .001) and was 3.6\% (95\% CI, 2.3\%-4.9\%; P < .001) lower for blacks than for whites matched also on treatment. In the presentation match, fewer blacks received treatment (87.4\% vs 91.8\%; P < .001), time from diagnosis to treatment was longer (29.2 vs 22.8 days; P < .001), use of anthracyclines and taxols was lower (3.7\% vs 5.0\%; P < .001), and breast-conserving surgery without other treatment was more frequent (8.2\% vs 7.3\%; P = .04). Nevertheless, differences in survival associated with treatment differences accounted for only 0.81\% of the 12.9\% survival difference. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the SEER-Medicare database, differences in breast cancer survival between black and white women did not substantially change among women diagnosed between 1991 and 2005. These differences in survival appear primarily related to presentation characteristics at diagnosis rather than treatment differences.},

	Abstract = {All empirical social research rests, at least implicitly,
on not one but two theories: a theory explaining the
phenomenon under study, another theory explaining the
generation of evidence concerning the phenomenon. The two
theories necessarily interact, setting important
constraints on each other. The second theory answers
questions about how the phenomenon leaves traces, how
analysts can observe those traces, and how analysts can
reconstruct attributes, elements, causes, and effects of
the phenomenon from those traces. As employed in studies of
contentious politics, event catalogs raise all these
questions. Competing conceptions of the phenomenon under
study as protest, as collective violence, as collective
action, as conflict, and as contentious claim-making imply
different measurement strategies. The strategy of
aggregation follows plausibly from identification of the
phenomenon as protest or violence, the strategy of
incidence from most of the competing conceptions, the
strategy of internal regularities only from treatments of
the crucial phenomenon as collective action, conflict, or
contentious claim-making.},

@book{Butler1990Gender,

Nevertheless, she has resisted the urge to revise what has become a feminist classic (as well as an elegant defense of drag, given Butler's emphasis on the performative nature of gender). The book was produced, according to Butler, "as part of the cultural life of a collective struggle that has had, and will continue to have, some success in increasing the possibilities for a livable life for those who live, or try to live, on the sexual margins." An attack on the essentialism of French feminist theory and its basis in structuralist anthropology, <I>Gender Trouble</I> expands to address the cultural prejudices at play in genetic studies of sex determination, as well as the uses of gender parody, and also provides a critical genealogy of the naturalization of sex. A primer in gender studies--and sexy reading for college caf\'{e}s. <I>--Regina Marler</I> \} \{Since its publication in 1990, <i>Gender Trouble</i> has become one of the key works of contemporary feminist theory, and an essential work for anyone interested in the study of gender, queer theory, or the politics of sexuality in culture. This is the text where Judith Butler began to advance the ideas that would go on to take life as "performativity theory," as well as some of the first articulations of the possibility for subversive gender practices, and she writes in her preface to the 10th anniversary edition released in 1999 that one point of <i>Gender Trouble</i> was "not to prescribe a new gendered way of life [...] but to open up the field of possibility for gender [...]" Widely taught, and widely debated, <i>Gender Trouble</i> continues to offer a powerful critique of heteronormativity and of the function of gender in the modern world.\} \{In this highly-acclaimed subversive book, Butler examines the `trouble' with unproblematized appeals to sex/gender identities.

	Abstract = {Abstract--Recently there has been a surge in econometric work focusing on estimating average treatment effects under various sets of assumptions. One strand of this literature has developed methods for estimating average treatment effects for a binary treatment under assumptions variously described as exogeneity, unconfoundedness, or selection on observables. The implication of these assumptions is that systematic (for example, average or distributional) differences in outcomes between treated and control units with the same values for the covariates are attributable to the treatment. Recent analysis has considered estimation and inference for average treatment effects under weaker assumptions than typical of the earlier literature by avoiding distributional and functional-form assumptions. Various methods of semiparametric estimation have been proposed, including estimating the unknown regression functions, matching, methods using the propensity score such as weighting and blocking, and combinations of these approaches. In this paper I review the state of this literature and discuss some of its unanswered questions, focusing in particular on the practical implementation of these methods, the plausibility of this exogeneity assumption in economic applications, the relative performance of the various semiparametric estimators when the key assumptions (unconfoundedness and overlap) are satisfied, alternative estimands such as quantile treatment effects, and alternate methods such as Bayesian inference.},

	Abstract = {This paper elaborates statistical models for the analysis of regulatory review deadlines or ``review time goals'' and their influence upon regulatory decisions. We outline two sets of statistical methods for estimating the models. In the first set, dynamic duration models of time to decision are elaborated, with particular focus on semi-parametric methods from which the behavioral structure of a regulatory review can be induced or ``backed out.'' In the second set, we consider different estimators for observational analysis of whether the deadlines in question influence the ``quality'' of the reviews or the likelihood of error. In particular, we consider how to use results from the ``first stage'' (induced behavioral review structure) to test whether deadlines influence the distribution of error. We apply these methods to the imposition of review-time goals by the Prescription Drug User-Fee Act (PDUFA) and its amended successors upon new drug review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Using the first set of methods, we find broad evidence that the deadlines have induced a piling of approvals right before the deadline elapses. Using the second set of methods, we find that these ``pre-deadline'' approvals are subject to substantially different post market experiences than drugs approved either after the deadlines or ``very early'' in the approval process.},

Initiative and referendum processes furnish citizens with insufficient information about policy problems, inadequate choices among policy solutions, flawed criteria for choosing among such solutions, and few opportunities for reflection on those choices prior to decision making. We suggest a way to make direct democracy more deliberative by grafting randomly selected citizen assemblies onto existing institutions and practices. After reviewing the problems that beset modern direct-democratic elections and the long history of randomly selected citizen assemblies, we propose five different varieties of randomly constituted citizen bodies---Priority Conferences, Design Panels, Citizens' Assemblies, Citizens' Initiative Reviews, and Policy Juries. After selecting members through stratified random sampling of citizens, each of these assemblies would operate at a different stage of the legislative process, from initial problem identification through approval of a finished ballot measure. Highly structured procedures guided by professional moderators and featuring expert testimony on policy and legal matters would help to ensure deliberative quality, and careful institutional designs would make each body politically powerful. In the end, these citizen bodies would be likely to address the deliberative deficit of direct democracy and better achieve the public's desired policy objectives.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM), however, are consistent even in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications that use a HCCM appear to rely on the asymptotic version known as HC0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that HC0 often results in incorrect inferences when N $\backslash$leq 250, while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of the HCCM, and especially a version known as HC3, work well even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a HCCM whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2) the decision to use HCCM-based tests should not be determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and (3) when N $\backslash$leq 250, the HCCM known as HC3 should be used. Since HC3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors of statistical software to add this estimator to their programs.

Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10\% of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},

In problems where the true regression function is sparse and the signals large, such crossvali- dation typically works well, with the Adaptive Lasso being an oracle method. However, in regression modeling of genomic studies involving Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), the true regression functions, while thought to be sparse, do not have large signals. We demonstrate empirically that in such problems, the number of selected variables using the Adaptive Lasso with 10-fold crossvalidation is a random variable that has considerable and surprising variation. Similar remarks apply to the Lasso. Our study strongly questions the suitability of performing only a single run of m-fold crossvalidation with any oracle method,
and not just the Adaptive Lasso.},

Analysts regularly (if not always self-consciously) choose

in two important regards: (1) from direct to analogical

numerical to topological correspondence between formalism

@article{Silber2005a,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications are common in the Medicare population, yet no study has formally quantified the change in prognosis that occurs after a broad range of first complications. OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the relative severity of 24 first postoperative complications. RESEARCH DESIGN: We undertook a multivariate matched, population-based, case-control study of death after surgery in a sample of 1362 Pennsylvania Medicare patients. SUBJECTS: Cases (681 deaths) were selected randomly using claims from 1995-1996. Models were developed to scan all Pennsylvania claims, looking for similar controls that did not die. MEASURES: Charts were abstracted, complications identified, and models were constructed to estimate the odds of dying after any 1 of 24 first postoperative complications. RESULTS: The odds of dying within 60 days increased 3.4-fold (95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.5-4.7) in patients with complications as compared with those without complications. A first complication of respiratory compromise was associated with a 7.2-fold increase in the odds of dying (95\% CI 4.5-11.6). The first complications of pneumonia or congestive heart failure were associated with, respectively, 5-fold (95\% CI 2.1-12.1) and 5.1-fold (2.3-11.1) increases in odds of dying as compared with no complication. CONCLUSIONS: First complications after surgery, even seemingly mild ones, may radically alter the patient's risk of death. First complications often begin the cascade of complications that end in death. Caregivers should consider the first complication as a timely signal of a changed clinical situation demanding a reevaluation of the patient's care. Researchers may use these estimates to determine the relative severity of a broad range of first or early complications.},

	Abstract = {Often, the protocol for a randomized controlled trial states that$\backslash$nif a patient's health deteriorates substantially in certain specific$\backslash$nways, then the study treatments will no longer be considered adequate$\backslash$nmedical care, and the patient will be taken off the study treatments$\backslash$nand given the needed care. Aberrant responses of this sort present$\backslash$nspecial problems of interpretation. The few such patients may have$\backslash$nreceived only limited exposure to the study treatments, but also$\backslash$nmay have experienced some of the worst outcomes observed in the trial.$\backslash$nThe most basic question is whether one of the treatments tends to$\backslash$ncause such aberrant responses, quite apart from any other beneficial$\backslash$nor harmful effects that treatment may have. Common practice is to$\backslash$nreduce aberrant responses to binary events and apply Fisher's exact$\backslash$ntest for a 2 x 2 table, but this approach discards the available$\backslash$ninformation about the magnitude of the aberration. We propose a new$\backslash$nrandomization test for this problem that uses information about both$\backslash$nthe number of aberrations and their magnitude. In extreme situations,$\backslash$nthe new test reduces to either Fisher's exact test or Wilcoxon's$\backslash$nrank sum test, but in common situations, the new test has features$\backslash$nof both methods. Importantly, this exact test reacts only to aberrant$\backslash$neffects; it is completely unaffected by treatment effects that do$\backslash$nnot produce aberrations. When aberrant responses have several aspects,$\backslash$nwe examine the consequences of selecting, after the fact, the one$\backslash$naspect exhibiting the greatest aberration, and applying the test$\backslash$nto that aspect. For a single response variable, a confidence interval$\backslash$nis proposed for an additive aberrant effect; the interval is constructed$\backslash$nby inverting the test, and a multivariate extension is briefly mentioned.$\backslash$nWe illustrate the use of the test in the ACE-Inhibitor After Anthracycline$\backslash$n(AAA) randomized trial, which was aimed at preserving cardiac function$\backslash$nin children treated for cancer. Seven of 135 children were removed$\backslash$nfrom the trial due to substantial cardiac declines; 6 of these were$\backslash$non placebo, I of whom subsequently died.},

	Abstract = {Summary In an observational or nonrandomized study of treatment effects, a sensitivity analysis indicates the magnitude of bias from unmeasured covariates that would need to be present to alter the conclusions of a na\"{\i}ve analysis that presumes adjustments for observed covariates suffice to remove all bias. The power of sensitivity analysis is the probability that it will reject a false hypothesis about treatment effects allowing for a departure from random assignment of a specified magnitude; in particular, if this specified magnitude is "no departure" then this is the same as the power of a randomization test in a randomized experiment. A new family of u-statistics is proposed that includes Wilcoxon's signed rank statistic but also includes other statistics with substantially higher power when a sensitivity analysis is performed in an observational study. Wilcoxon's statistic has high power to detect small effects in large randomized experiments-that is, it often has good Pitman efficiency-but small effects are invariably sensitive to small unobserved biases. Members of this family of u-statistics that emphasize medium to large effects can have substantially higher power in a sensitivity analysis. For example, in one situation with 250 pair differences that are Normal with expectation 1/2 and variance 1, the power of a sensitivity analysis that uses Wilcoxon's statistic is 0.08 while the power of another member of the family of u-statistics is 0.66. The topic is examined by performing a sensitivity analysis in three observational studies, using an asymptotic measure called the design sensitivity, and by simulating power in finite samples. The three examples are drawn from epidemiology, clinical medicine, and genetic toxicology.},

The second, <I>Envisioning Information,</I> explores similar territory but with an emphasis on maps and cartography. <I>Visual Explanations</I> centers on dynamic data--information that changes over time. (Tufte has described the three books as being about, respectively, ``pictures of numbers, pictures of nouns, and pictures of verbs.'') <P> Like its predecessors, <I>Visual Explanations</I> is both intellectually stimulating and beautiful to behold. Tufte, a self-publisher, takes extraordinary pains with design and production. The book ranges through a variety of topics, including the explosion of the space shuttle <I>Challenger</I> (which could have been prevented, Tufte argues, by better information display on the part of the rocket's engineers), magic tricks, a cholera epidemic in 19th-century London, and the principle of using ``the smallest effective difference'' to display distinctions in data.

@article{Yang2012,
	Abstract = {In multivariate matching, fine balance constrains the marginal distributions of a nominal variable in treated and matched control groups to be identical without constraining who is matched to whom. In this way, a fine balance constraint can balance a nominal variable with many levels while focusing efforts on other more important variables when pairing individuals to minimize the total covariate distance within pairs. Fine balance is not always possible; that is, it is a constraint on an optimization problem, but the constraint is not always feasible. We propose a new algorithm that returns a minimum distance finely balanced match when one is feasible, and otherwise minimizes the total distance among all matched samples that minimize the deviation from fine balance. Perhaps we can come very close to fine balance when fine balance is not attainable; moreover, in any event, because our algorithm is guaranteed to come as close as possible to fine balance, the investigator may perform one match, and on that basis judge whether the best attainable balance is adequate or not. We also show how to incorporate an additional constraint. The algorithm is implemented in two similar ways, first as an optimal assignment problem with an augmented distance matrix, second as a minimum cost flow problem in a network. The case of knee surgery in the Obesity and Surgical Outcomes Study motivated the development of this algorithm and is used as an illustration. In that example, 2 of 47 hospitals had too few nonobese patients to permit fine balance for the nominal variable with 47 levels representing the hospital, but our new algorithm came very close to fine balance. Moreover, in that example, there was a shortage of nonobese diabetic patients, and incorporation of an additional constraint forced the match to include all of these nonobese diabetic patients, thereby coming as close as possible to balance for this important but recalcitrant covariate.},

	Abstract = {We develop a Bayesian ``sum-of-trees'' model where each tree is constrained by a regularization prior to be a weak learner, and fitting and inference are accomplished via an iterative Bayesian backfitting MCMC algorithm that generates samples from a posterior. Effectively, BART is a nonparametric Bayesian regression approach which uses dimensionally adaptive random basis elements. Motivated by ensemble methods in general, and boosting algorithms in particular, BART is defined by a statistical model: a prior and a likelihood. This approach enables full posterior inference including point and interval estimates of the unknown regression function as well as the marginal effects of potential predictors. By keeping track of predictor inclusion frequencies, BART can also be used for model-free variable selection. BART's many features are illustrated with a bake-off against competing methods on 42 different data sets, with a simulation experiment and on a drug discovery classification problem.

@article{Neuman2014,
	Abstract = {IMPORTANCE: More than 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the United States. Recent practice guidelines have advocated greater use of regional anesthesia for hip fracture surgery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To test the association of regional (ie, spinal or epidural) anesthesia vs general anesthesia with 30-day mortality and hospital length of stay after hip fracture.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study involving patients 50 years or older who were undergoing surgery for hip fracture at general acute care hospitals in New York State between July 1, 2004, and December 31, 2011. Our main analysis was a near-far instrumental variable match that paired patients who lived at different distances from hospitals that specialized in regional or general anesthesia. Supplementary analyses included a within-hospital match that paired patients within the same hospital and an across-hospital match that paired patients at different hospitals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPOSURES: Spinal or epidural anesthesia; general anesthesia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Thirty-day mortality and hospital length of stay. Because the distribution of length of stay had long tails, we characterized this outcome using the Huber M estimate with Huber weights, a robust estimator similar to a trimmed mean.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 56,729 patients, 15,904 (28\%) received regional anesthesia and 40,825 (72\%) received general anesthesia. Overall, 3032 patients (5.3\%) died. The M estimate of the length of stay was 6.2 days (95\% CI, 6.2 to 6.2). The near-far matched analysis showed no significant difference in 30-day mortality by anesthesia type among the 21,514 patients included in this match: 583 of 10,757 matched patients (5.4\%) who lived near a regional anesthesia-specialized hospital died vs 629 of 10,757 matched patients (5.8\%) who lived near a general anesthesia-specialized hospital (instrumental variable estimate of risk difference, -1.1\%; 95\% CI, -2.8 to 0.5; P = .20). Supplementary analyses of within and across hospital patient matches yielded mortality findings to be similar to the main analysis. In the near-far match, regional anesthesia was associated with a 0.6-day shorter length of stay than general anesthesia (95\% CI, -0.8 to -0.4, P < .001). Supplementary analyses also showed regional anesthesia to be associated with shorter length of stay, although the observed association was smaller in magnitude than in the main analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults in acute care hospitals in New York State undergoing hip repair, the use of regional anesthesia compared with general anesthesia was not associated with lower 30-day mortality but was associated with a modestly shorter length of stay. These findings do not support a mortality benefit for regional anesthesia in this setting.},

Moreover, with this great honor bestowed on my ``con'' article, I couldn't easily throw this child of mine overboard. As Angrist and Pischke persuasively argue, either purposefully randomized experiments or accidentally randomized ``natural'' experiments can be extremely helpful, but Angrist and Pischke seem to me to overstate the potential benefits of the approach. I begin with some thoughts about the inevitable limits of randomization, and the need for sensitivity analysis in this area, as in all areas of applied empirical work. I argue that the recent financial catastrop},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand differences in length of stay for asthma patients between New York State and Pennsylvania across children's and general hospitals in order to better guide policy. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: All pediatric admissions for asthma in the states of Pennsylvania and New York using claims data obtained from each state for the years 1996-1998, n = 38,310. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort design to model length of stay (LOS), the probability of prolonged stay, conditional length of stay (CLOS or the LOS after stay is prolonged), and the probability of readmission, controlling for patient factors, state, location and hospital type. ANALYTIC METHODS: Logit models were used to estimate the probability of prolonged stay and readmission. The LOS and the CLOS were estimated with Cox regression. Model variables included comorbidities, income, race, distance from hospital, and insurance type. Prolonged stay was based on a Hollander-Proschan "New-Worse-Than-Used" test, corresponding to a three-day stay. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The LOS was longer in New York than Pennsylvania, and the probabilities of prolonged stay and readmission were much higher in New York than Pennsylvania. However, once an admission was prolonged, there were no differences in CLOS between states (when readmissions were not added to the LOS calculation). In both states, children's hospitals and general hospitals had similar adjusted LOS. CONCLUSIONS: Management of asthma appears more efficient in Pennsylvania than New York: Less severe patients are discharged faster in Pennsylvania than New York; once discharged, patients are less likely to be readmitted in Pennsylvania than New York. However, once a stay is prolonged, there is little difference between New York and Pennsylvania, suggesting medical care for severely ill patients is similar across states. Differences between children's and general hospitals were small as compared to differences between states. We conclude that policy initiatives in New York, and other states, should focus their efforts on improving the care provided to less severe patients in order to help reduce overall length of stay.},

Findings about parental influence based on youth coming of age in the 1990s strongly parallel those based on youth socialized in the 1960s. As expected on the basis of social learning theory, children are more likely to adopt their parents political orientations if the family is highly politicized and if the parents provide consistent cues over time. The direct transmission model is robust, as it withstands an extensive set of controls. Early acquisition of parental characteristics influences the subsequent nature of adult political development.},

deductive reasoning, the theoretical route. However
inductive logic, the experimental method, is also feasible

clarify the issues in cases where there are long-standing
conceptual problems; we have applied this technique to the
problem of the marginal totals in Fisher's exact test. It
becomes clear that both margins should be fixed. We
conclude that there are advantages if the strategy natural
to the mathematician, on the one hand, and the scientist,
on the other, are used concurrently.},

@article{Lorch2004,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many children receive their care at local hospitals outside of a large urban area. There may be differences in the length of stay (LOS) between children hospitalized in rural versus urban hospitals. This study compared the differences in LOS, conditional LOS (CLOS), odds of prolonged stay, and 21-day readmission rates for children with 19 medical conditions and 9 surgical procedures admitted to rural, community, and large urban hospitals. METHODS: Discharge records for the hospitalizations of children 1 to 17 years of age were obtained from the New York Department of Public Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council for April 1996 to July 1998. The 19 medical and 9 surgical conditions were identified with the principal condition and procedure codes. Hospitals were classified into 1 of 5 geographic categories on the basis of United States rural-urban continuum codes, ie, large urban, suburban, moderate urban, small urban, or rural. LOS was defined as the period of time between hospital admission and discharge. Readmission rates were calculated for 21 days after discharge from the hospital. A prolonged stay for each condition was defined as any admission lasting beyond the prolongation point, or the day at which the rate of discharge began to decline, as determined with the Hollander-Proschan statistic. This aspect of LOS describes the ability of providers to treat uncomplicated cases of that specific principle diagnosis. CLOS, as a marker for the management of complicated cases, was defined as the LOS beyond the prolongation point. Cox and logistic regression models were developed to describe the geographic effects on the 4 outcome variables, after severity adjustment with 32 demographic and 11 comorbidity variables and adjustment for hospital clustering. RESULTS: Medical (N = 114,787) and surgical (N = 29,156) admissions to rural hospitals (N = 12,367) had similar outcomes, compared with all geographic categories except the large urban category. Medical patients admitted to rural hospitals had a shorter LOS (12\% increase in discharge rate), a shorter CLOS (12\% increase in discharge rate), and lower odds of prolonged stay (odds ratio: 0.80), compared with those in large urban hospitals. Surgical patients admitted to rural hospitals had a shorter LOS (12\% increase in discharge rate) and lower odds of prolonged stay (odds ratio: 0.81), compared with those in large urban hospitals. For individual conditions, rural hospitals in general had similar or improved LOS, compared with all other hospitals in the 2 states. The addition of hospital-level variables failed to change the results of the primary models. CONCLUSIONS: In their treatment of pediatric hospitalized patients, rural hospitals were not significantly different from hospitals in all geographic regions other than large urban areas. Rural hospitals appear to deliver similar care, compared with nonrural hospitals, for many of the common pediatric conditions included in this study. Additional research is needed to apply these results to other regions or states with different geographic distributions of hospitals and children, in order to determine the overall impact on the regionalization of pediatric care.},

@article{Rosenbaum2013,
	Abstract = {In an observational study, one treated subject may be matched for observed covariates to either one or several untreated controls. The common motivation for using several controls rather than one is to increase the power of a test of no effect under the doubtful assumption that matching for observed covariates suffices to remove bias from nonrandom treatment assignment. Does the choice between one or several matched controls affect the sensitivity of conclusions to violations of this doubtful assumption? With continuous responses, it is known that reducing the heterogeneity of matched pair differences reduces sensitivity to unmeasured biases, but increasing the sample size has a highly circumscribed effect on sensitivity to bias. Is the use of several controls rather than one analogous to a reduction in heterogeneity or to an increase in sample size? The issue is examined for Huber's m-statistics, including the t-test, the examination having three components: an example, asymptotic calculations using design sensitivity, and a simulation. Use of multiple controls with continuous responses yields a nontrivial reduction in sensitivity to unmeasured biases. An example looks at lead and cadmium in the blood of smokers from the 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A by-product of the discussion is a new result giving the design sensitivity for the permutation distribution of m-statistics.},

In this article, we borrow from Parsons and Shils to offer a conceptualization of context. This conceptualization, and a recognition of both Lippmann's pseduoenvironments and the statistical Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, lead us to a new measurement strategy. We propose a map-based measure to capture how ordinary people use information about their environments to make decisions about politics. Respondents draw their contexts on maps--deciding the boundaries of their relevant environments--and describe their perceptions of hte demographic make-up of these contexts. The evidence is clear: `pictures in our heads' do not resemble governmental administrative units in shape or content. By `bringing the person back in' to the measurement of context, we are able to marry psychological theories of information processing with sociological theories of racial threat.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine if the lower mortality often observed in teaching-intensive hospitals is because of lower complication rates or lower death rates after complications (failure to rescue) and whether the benefits at these hospitals accrue equally to white and black patients, since black patients receive a disproportionate share of their care at teaching-intensive hospitals. DESIGN: A retrospective study of patient outcomes and teaching intensity using logistic regression models, with and without adjusting for hospital fixed and random effects. SETTING: Three thousand two hundred seventy acute care hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS: Medicare claims on general, orthopedic, and vascular surgery admissions in the United States for 2000-2005 (N = 4,658,954 unique patients). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thirty-day mortality, in-hospital complications, and failure to rescue (the probability of death following complications). RESULTS: Combining all surgeries, compared with nonteaching hospitals, patients at very major teaching hospitals demonstrated a 15\% lower odds of death (P < .001), no difference in complications, and a 15\% lower odds of death after complications (failure to rescue) (P < .001). These relative benefits associated with higher resident-to-bed ratio were not experienced by black patients, for whom the odds of mortality and failure to rescue were similar at teaching and nonteaching hospitals, a pattern that is significantly different from that of white patients (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Survival after surgery is higher at hospitals with higher teaching intensity. Improved survival is because of lower mortality after complications (better failure to rescue) and generally not because of fewer complications. However, this better survival and failure to rescue at teaching-intensive hospitals is seen for white patients, not for black patients.},

@article{bres:1996,
	Abstract = {Statisticians have contributed enormously to the
conceptualization, development, and success of case-control
methods for the study of disease causation and prevention.
This article reviews the major developments. It starts with
Cornfield's demonstration of odds ratio invariance under
cohort versus case-control sampling, proceeds through the
still-popular Mantel-Haenszel procedure and its extensions
for dependent data, and highlights (conditional) likelihood
methods for relative risk regression. Recent work on nested
case-control, case-cohort, and two-stage case-control
designs demonstrates the continuing impact of statistical
thinking on epidemiology. The influence of R. A. Fisher's
work on these developments is mentioned wherever possible.
His objections to the drawing of causal conclusions from
observational data on cigarette smoking and lung cancer are
used to introduce the problems of measurement error and
confounding bias. The resolution of such difficulties,
whether by further development and implementation of
randomized intervention trials or by causal analysis of
observational data using graphical models containing latent
variables, will challenge future generations of
statisticians.},

	Abstract = {A Bayesian method is developed for estimating neural
responses to stimuli, using likelihood functions
incorporating the assumption that spike trains follow
either pure Poisson statistics or Poisson statistics with a
refractory period. The Bayesian and standard estimates of
the mean and variance of responses are similar and
asymptotically converge as the size of the data sample
increases. However, the Bayesian estimate of the variance
of the variance is much lower. This allows the Bayesian
method to provide more precise interval estimates of
responses. Sensitivity of the Bayesian method to the
Poisson assumption was tested by conducting simulations
perturbing the Poisson spike trains with noise. This did
not affect Bayesian estimates of mean and variance to a
significant degree, indicating that the Bayesian method is
robust. The Bayesian estimates were less affected by the
presence of noise than estimates provided by the standard
method.},

The large-sample distributions are derived both for the case where the adaptive LASSO estimator is tuned to perform conservative model selection as well as for the case where the tuning results in consistent model selection. We show that the finite-sample as well as the large-sample distributions are typically highly nonnormal, regardless of the choice of the tuning parameter. The uniform convergence rate is also obtained, and is shown to be slower than n-1/2 in case the estimator is tuned to perform consistent model selection. In particular, these results question the statistical relevance of the [`]oracle' property of the adaptive LASSO estimator established in Zou [2006. The adaptive LASSO and its oracle properties. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101, 1418-1429]. Moreover, we also provide an impossibility result regarding the estimation of the distribution function of the adaptive LASSO estimator.

@book{Nestle2007Food,
	Abstract = {In the U.S., we're bombarded with nutritional advice--the work, we assume, of reliable authorities with our best interests at heart. Far from it, says Marion Nestle, whose <I>Food Politics</I> absorbingly details how the food industry--through lobbying, advertising, and the co-opting of experts--influences our dietary choices to our detriment. Central to her argument is the American "paradox of plenty," the recognition that our food abundance (we've enough calories to meet every citizen's needs twice over) leads profit-fixated food producers to do everything possible to broaden their market portion, thus swaying us to eat <I>more</I> when we should do the opposite. The result is compromised health: epidemic obesity to start, and increased vulnerability to heart and lung disease, cancer, and stroke--reversible if the constantly suppressed "eat less, move more" message that most nutritionists shout could be heard. <p> Nestle, nutrition chair at New York University and editor of the 1988 Surgeon General Report, has served her time in the dietary trenches and is ideally suited to revealing how government nutritional advice is watered down when a message might threaten industry sales. (Her report on byzantine nutritional food-pyramid rewordings to avoid "eat less" recommendations is both predictable and astonishing.) She has other "war stories," too, that involve marketing to children in school (in the form of soft-drink "pouring rights" agreements, hallway advertising, and fast-food coupon giveaways), and diet-supplement dramas in which manufacturers and the government enter regulation frays, with the industry championing "free choice" even as that position counters consumer protection. Is there hope? "If we want to encourage people to eat better diets," says Nestle, "we need to target societal means to counter food industry lobbying and marketing practices as well as the education of individuals." It's a telling conclusion in an engrossing and masterfully panoramic expos\'{e}. <I>--Arthur Boehm</I> An accessible and balanced account, <I>Food Politics </I>laid the groundwork for today's food revolution and changed the way we respond to food industry marketing practices. Now, a new introduction and concluding chapter bring us up to date on the key events in that movement. This pathbreaking, prize-winning book helps us understand more clearly than ever before what we eat and why.},

It is a vehicle for generational moods and aspirations, a public refuge for fantasies outlawed in daily life, a testing ground for technical ingenuity, an enormously profitable commercial channel for mainstream narratives of thought and behavior, and one of the corporate state's main theatres for national moral panic. Today's sounds, and the debates about their various forms, are inseparable from the social conditions of the last two decades: class polarization, racial marginalization, and economic violence enacted to a degree that has left youth, as a whole, with drastically reduced opportunities in life. Youth culture is still responding to these uneven developments with a passion that has been romanticized by some critics as a significant form of resistance, and denigrated by others as an avoidance of direct and political protest.<br><br><b></b><b><i>Microphone Fiends</i></b><b></b>, a collection of original essays and interviews, brings together some of the best known scholars, critics, journalists and performers to focus on the contemporary scene. It includes theoretical discussions of musical history along with social commentaries about genres like disco, metal and rap music, and case histories of specific movements like the Riot Grrls, funk clubbing in Rio de Janeiro, and the British rave scene. The contents of the volume engage with the broad tradition of cultural studies and sociology of youth music and culture, but they are also designed to address audiences reached by mainstream music journalism and fans of any musical taste.},

The ACE-Inhibitor After Anthracycline (AAA) study compared enalapril to placebo in a randomized trial in an effort to determine whether treatment with enalapril would preserve or improve cardiac function among children previously treated with anthracylines. As is true in many clinical trials, patient compliance with the study protocol was imperfect; some children took less than the prescribed dose of enalapril or placebo. Most analytical procedures that acknowledge imperfect compliance do so at significant cost, abandoning the tight logic of random assignment. With noncompliance, assignment to enalapril or placebo is randomized, but the dose of enalapril actually received is not, and self-selection effects parallel to those in observational studies can exist and have been documented in some instances. Some researchers advocate adherence to the strict logic of randomization by reporting only, or else strongly emphasizing, the so-called ?intent-to-treat? analysis, which makes no use of information about compliance. Other researchers report analyses that are not justified by random assignment and can be subject to substantial biases, such as ?per protocol? analyses or ?treatment received? analyses.

We make no assumption that compliance is random; indeed, compliance may be severely biased. Importantly, the proposed analysis will find a statistically significant effect of the treatment if and only if the intent-to-treat analysis finds a significant effect; yet, unlike intent-to-treat analysis, our analysis acknowledges that a patient assigned to a drug that he or she does not take will not receive the drug's pharmacological benefits.$\backslash$nAnthracyclines are quite effective at curing certain cancers of childhood, but they may damage the heart.

	Abstract = {Community food security (CFS) is an incipient movement based on the re-localization of many food system activities in response to values concerning the social, health, economic, and environmental consequences of the globalizing food system. This study examines the salience of these values based on the action agendas and accomplishments emerging from community planning events in six rural counties of New York, and the nature and type of participation and local support. The study finds a high level of agreement between CFS values as articulated by national leaders in this incipient movement and the action agendas. Further evidence of the salience of these themes is seen in the levels and types of activities and accomplishments taking place 8--12 months after the planning events. However, these follow-through activities appear to have been impeded by a variety of government regulations, uneven levels of support from community organizations and agencies, and a policy environment of fiscal austerity, narrow outcome-oriented accountability, and allocation of agency staff toward special-purpose grants and contracts. Many of these constraints are likely to exist in other communities and are beyond the scope of what community volunteers and practitioners can be expected to address on their own.},

A previous paper (Rosenbaum, 1987a) proposed a method for displaying the sensitivity of permutation inferences to bias due to an unobserved covariate in two cases: (i) the case of matched pairs, with arbitrary response variables, and (ii) the case of matching with multiple controls in the special case of binary responses. The current note shows that an analogous argument applies in the case of matching with multiple controls with arbitrary responses, providing the test statistic used is a member of a certain family of generalizations of Wilcoxon's signed-rank statistic, a family that includes methods for binary and censored data.},

Maximum likelihood estimators have excellent asymptotic properties but less than ideal small sample properties. Multilevel models common in political science have relatively large samples of units like individuals nested within relatively small samples of units like countries. Often these level-2 samples will be so small as to make inference about level-2 effects uninterpretable in the likelihood framework from which they were estimated. When analysts do not have enough data to make a compelling argument for repeated sampling based probabilistic inference, we show how visualization can be a useful way of allowing scientific progress to continue despite lack of fit between research design and asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators.},

Empirical tests of this theory have been unable to isolate the effect of education from other factors that impact participation. We propose an alternative definition in which education is measured relative to those born in the same year. This is used to estimate a model of voter turnout that controls for both absolute and relative education. The results show that this new measure of relative education has far more explanatory power than does absolute education. This finding has significant implications regarding how education affects both aggregate voter turnout levels and inequality in voter participation.},

	Abstract = {MEDLINE Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Difference in breast cancer survival by race is a recognized problem among Medicare beneficiaries. OBJECTIVE: To determine if racial disparity in breast cancer survival is primarily attributable to differences in presentation characteristics at diagnosis or subsequent treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Comparison of 7375 black women 65 years and older diagnosed between 1991 to 2005 and 3 sets of 7375 matched white control patients selected from 99,898 white potential controls, using data for 16 US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) sites in the SEER-Medicare database. All patients received follow-up through December 31, 2009, and the black case patients were matched to 3 white control populations on demographics (age, year of diagnosis, and SEER site), presentation (demographics variables plus patient comorbid conditions and tumor characteristics such as stage, size, grade, and estrogen receptor status), and treatment (presentation variables plus details of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 5-Year survival. RESULTS: The absolute difference in 5-year survival (blacks, 55.9\%; whites, 68.8\%) was 12.9\% (95\% CI, 11.5\%-14.5\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001) in the demographics match. This difference remained unchanged between 1991 and 2005. After matching on presentation characteristics, the absolute difference in 5-year survival was 4.4\% (95\% CI, 2.8\%-5.8\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001) and was 3.6\% (95\% CI, 2.3\%-4.9\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001) lower for blacks than for whites matched also on treatment. In the presentation match, fewer blacks received treatment (87.4\% vs 91.8\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001), time from diagnosis to treatment was longer (29.2 vs 22.8 days; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001), use of anthracyclines and taxols was lower (3.7\% vs 5.0\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}<\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.001), and breast-conserving surgery without other treatment was more frequent (8.2\% vs 7.3\%; P\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}=\^{a}\c{C}\"{e}.04). Nevertheless, differences in survival associated with treatment differences accounted for only 0.81\% of the 12.9\% survival difference. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the SEER-Medicare database, differences in breast cancer survival between black and white women did not substantially change among women diagnosed between 1991 and 2005. These differences in survival appear primarily related to presentation characteristics at diagnosis rather than treatment differences},

The differential effect of the two treatments is the effect of applying one treatment in lieu of the other. In randomised experiments, the differential effect is of no more or less interest than other treatment contrasts. Differential effects play a special role in certain observational studies in which treatments are not assigned to subjects at random, where differing outcomes may reflect biased assignments rather than effects caused by the treatments. Differential effects are immune to certain types of unobserved bias, called generic biases, which are associated with both treatments in a similar way. This is explored using several examples and models. Differential effects are not immune to differential biases, whose possible consequences are examined by sensitivity analysis.},

Doreen's descriptions of her journey through England for example are clear and precise accounts of this idea, and she very sharply characterizes the attempts not to recognize this idea as utopian and nostalgic." </em><br />- Olafur Eliasson <p></p><p></p><p>In this book, Doreen Massey makes an impassioned argument for revitalising our imagination of space. She takes on some well-established assumptions from philosophy, and some familiar ways of characterising the twenty-first century world, and shows how they restrain our understanding of both the challenge and the potential of space.</p><p></p><p>The way we think about space matters. It inflects our understandings of the world, our attitudes to others, our politics. It affects, for instance, the way we understand globalisation, the way we approach cities, the way we develop, and practice, a sense of place. If time is the dimension of change then space is the dimension of the social: the contemporaneous co-existence of others. That is its challenge, and one that has been persistently evaded. <b>For Space</b> pursues its argument through philosophical and theoretical engagement, and through telling personal and political reflection. Doreen Massey asks questions such as how best to characterise these so-called spatial times, how it is that implicit spatial assumptions inflect our politics, and how we might develop a responsibility for place beyond place.</p><p></p><p>This book is "for space" in that it argues for a reinvigoration of the spatiality of our implicit cosmologies. <b>For Space </b>is essential reading for anyone interested in space and the spatial turn in the social sciences and humanities. Serious, and sometimes irreverent, it is a compelling manifesto: for re-imagining spaces for these times and facing up to their challenge.</p>},

	Abstract = {A sensitivity analysis displays the increase in uncertainty that attends an inference when a key assumption is relaxed. In matched observational studies of treatment effects, a key assumption in some analyses is that subjects matched for observed covariates are comparable, and this assumption is relaxed by positing a relevant covariate that was not observed and not controlled by matching. What properties would such an unobserved covariate need to have to materially alter the inference about treatment effects? For ease of calculation and reporting, it is convenient that the sensitivity analysis be of low dimension, perhaps indexed by a scalar sensitivity parameter, but for interpretation in specific contexts, a higher dimensional analysis may be of greater relevance. An amplification of a sensitivity analysis is defined as a map from each point in a low dimensional sensitivity analysis to a set of points, perhaps a 'curve,' in a higher dimensional sensitivity analysis such that the possible inferences are the same for all points in the set. Possessing an amplification, an investigator may calculate and report the low dimensional analysis, yet have available the interpretations of the higher dimensional analysis.},

	Abstract = {There are two treatments, each of which may be applied or withheld, yielding a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with three degrees of freedom between groups. The differential effect of the two treatments is the effect of applying one treatment in lieu of the other. In randomised experiments, the differential effect is of no more or less interest than other treatment contrasts. Differential effects play a special role in certain observational studies in which treatments are not assigned to subjects at random, where differing outcomes may reflect biased assignments rather than effects caused by the treatments. Differential effects are immune to certain types of unobserved bias, called generic biases, which are associated with both treatments in a similar way. This is explored using several examples and models. Differential effects are not immune to differential biases, whose possible consequences are examined by sensitivity analysis.},

@article{Zubizarreta2012,
	Abstract = {In a randomized trial, subjects are assigned to treatment or control by the flip of a fair coin. In many nonrandomized or observational studies, subjects find their way to treatment or control in two steps, either or both of which may lead to biased comparisons. By a vague process, perhaps affected by proximity or sociodemographic issues, subjects find their way to institutions that provide treatment. Once at such an institution, a second process, perhaps thoughtful and deliberate, assigns individuals to treatment or control. In the current article, the institutions are hospitals, and the treatment under study is the use of general anesthesia alone versus some use of regional anesthesia during surgery. For a specific operation, the use of regional anesthesia may be typical in one hospital and atypical in another. A new matched design is proposed for studies of this sort, one that creates two types of nonoverlapping matched pairs. Using a new extension of optimal matching with fine balance, pairs of the first type exactly balance treatment assignment across institutions, so each institution appears in the treated group with the same frequency that it appears in the control group; hence, differences between institutions that affect everyone in the same way cannot bias this comparison. Pairs of the second type compare institutions that assign most subjects to treatment and other institutions that assign most subjects to control, so each institution is represented in the treated group if it typically assigns subjects to treatment or, alternatively, in the control group if it typically assigns subjects to control, and no institution appears in both groups. By and large, in the second type of matched pair, subjects became treated subjects or controls by choosing an institution, not by a thoughtful and deliberate process of selecting subjects for treatment within institutions. The design provides two evidence factors, that is, two tests of the null hypothesis of no treatment effect that are independent when the null hypothesis is true, where each factor is largely unaffected by certain unmeasured biases that could readily invalidate the other factor. The two factors permit separate and combined sensitivity analyses, where the magnitude of bias affecting the two factors may differ. The case of knee surgery in the study of regional versus general anesthesia is considered in detail.},

	Abstract = {The recent proliferation of scholarship on collective action frames and framing processes in relation to social movements indicates that framing processes have come to be regarded, alongside resource mobilization and political opportunity processes, as a central dynamic in understanding the character and course of social movements. This review examines the analytic utility of the framing literature for understanding social movement dynamics. We first review how collective action frames have been conceptualized, including their characteristic and variable features. We then examine the literature related to framing dynamics and processes. Next we review the literature regarding various contextual factors that constrain and facilitate framing processes. We conclude with an elaboration of the consequences of framing processes for other movement processes and outcomes. We seek throughout to provide clarification of the linkages between framing concepts/processes and other conceptual and theoretical formulations relevant to social movements, such as schemas and ideology.},

	Abstract = {A small literature discusses locally most powerful rank tests when only a fraction of treated subjects respond to treatment. The ranks used in these tests are very different from conventional ranks, being relatively flat for low responses and then rising steeply, and the associated tests are much more powerful than conventional rank tests when, indeed, only a small fraction of treated subjects exhibit dramatic responses. Because the tests are derived from considerations of local power, they do not yield a plausible family of models for effect, and therefore they do not yield confidence intervals for the magnitude of effect formed by inverting the tests. There is a similarity between these tests and another family of tests, originally motivated by different considerations involving peak performance in small subsets. Exploiting this similarity, a method for obtaining confidence statements is proposed. In the case of observational studies, sensitivity to unobserved bias from nonrandom assignment of treatments is also examined. Two examples are used as illustrations: (i) a study of smoking during pregnancy and its effects on birth weight, in which smokers are matched to six controls, and (ii) a matched pair study of damage to DNA among workers at aluminum production plants.},

	Abstract = {We draw attention to two problems associated with the use of instrumental variables (IV), the importance of which for empirical work has not been fully appreciated. First, the use of instruments that explain little of the variation in the endogenous explanatory variables can lead to large inconsistencies in the IV estimates even if only a weak relationship exists between the instruments and the error in the structural equation. Second, in finite samples, IV estimates are biased in the same direction as ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. The magnitude of the bias of IV estimates approaches that of OLS estimates as the R(2) between the instruments and the endogenous explanatory variable approaches 0. To illustrate these problems, we reexamine the results of a recent paper by Angrist and Krueger, who used large samples from the U.S. Census to estimate wage equations in which quarter of birth is used as an instrument for educational attainment. We find evidence that, despite huge sample sizes, their IV estimates may suffer from finite-sample bias and may be inconsistent as well. These findings suggest that valid instruments may be more difficult to find than previously imagined. They also indicate that the use of large data sets does not necessarily insulate researchers from quantitatively important finite-sample biases. We suggest that the partial R(2) and the F statistic of the identifying instruments in the first-stage estimation are useful indicators of the quality of the IV estimates and should be routinely reported.d},

@article{Lin1999,
	Abstract = {In the past two decades, social capital in its various forms and contexts has emerged as one of the most salient concepts in social sciences . While much excitement has been generated, divergent views, perspectives, and expectations have also raised the serious question : is it a fad or does it have enduring qualities that will herald a new intellectual enterprise? This presentation's purpose is to review social capital as discussed in the literature, identify controversies and debates, consider some critical issues, and propose conceptual and research strategies in building a theory. I will argue that such a theory and the research enterprise must be based on the fundamental understanding that social capital is captured from embedded resources in social networks . Deviations from this understanding in conceptualization and measurement lead to confusion in analyzing causal mechanisms in the macro- and microprocesses. It is precisely these mechanisms and processes, essential for an interactive theory about structure and action, to which social capital promises to make contributions . The paper will begin by exploring the nature of capital and various theories of capital, so that social capital can be properly perceived and located . It will then identify certain controversies which, unless clarified or resolved, will hinder the development of a theory and the research enterprise . By considering social capital as assets in networks, the paper will discuss some issues in conceptualizations, measurements, and causal mechanisms (the factors leading to inequality of social capital and the returns following investments in social capital) . A proposed model will follow . The paper will conclude by calling attention to the rise of a new form of social capital, cybernetworks, and briefly suggesting how research on this topic promises to make important contributions to the research enterprise .},

Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. MCMC constitutes a revolution
in statistical practice with effects beginning to be felt
in the social sciences: models long consigned to the \{"\}too

researchers. I review the statistical pedigree of MCMC and
the underlying statistical concepts. I demonstrate some of
the strengths and weaknesses of MCMC and offer practical
suggestions for using MCMC in social-science settings.
Simple, illustrative examples include a probit model of
voter turnout and a linear regression for time-series data
with autoregressive disturbances. I conclude with a more
challenging application, a multinomial probit model, to
showcase the power of MCMC methods.},

economic factors on public opinion toward immigration
policy Using the 1992 and 1994 National Election Study
surveys, probit models are employed to test diverse
conceptualizations of the effects of economic adversity and
anxiety on opposition to immigration The results indicate
that personal economic circumstances play little role in
opinion formation, but beliefs about the state of the
national economy, anxiety over taxes, and generalized
feelings about Hispanics and Asians, the major immigrant
groups, are significant determinants of restrictionist
sentiment. This restricted role of economic motives rooted
in one's personal circumstances held true across ethnic
groups, among residents in communities with different
numbers of foreign-born, and in both 1992 and 1994.},

@book{massey2005for,
	Abstract = {<em>"The reason for my enthusiasm for this book is that
Doreen Massey manages to describe a certain way of
perceiving movement in space which I have been - and still
am - working with on different levels in my work: i.e. the
idea that space is not something static and neutral, a
frozen entity, but is something intertwined with time and
thus ever changing - also when we are not occupying it.
Doreen's descriptions of her journey through England for
example are clear and precise accounts of this idea, and
she very sharply characterizes the attempts not to
recognize this idea as utopian and nostalgic." </em><br />-
Olafur Eliasson <p></p><p></p><p>In this book, Doreen
Massey makes an impassioned argument for revitalising our
imagination of space. She takes on some well-established
assumptions from philosophy, and some familiar ways of
characterising the twenty-first century world, and shows
how they restrain our understanding of both the challenge
and the potential of space.</p><p></p><p>The way we think
about space matters. It inflects our understandings of the
world, our attitudes to others, our politics. It affects,
for instance, the way we understand globalisation, the way
we approach cities, the way we develop, and practice, a
sense of place. If time is the dimension of change then
space is the dimension of the social: the contemporaneous
co-existence of others. That is its challenge, and one that
has been persistently evaded. <b>For Space</b> pursues its
argument through philosophical and theoretical engagement,
and through telling personal and political reflection.
Doreen Massey asks questions such as how best to
characterise these so-called spatial times, how it is that
implicit spatial assumptions inflect our politics, and how
we might develop a responsibility for place beyond
place.</p><p></p><p>This book is "for space" in that it
argues for a reinvigoration of the spatiality of our
implicit cosmologies. <b>For Space </b>is essential reading
for anyone interested in space and the spatial turn in the
social sciences and humanities. Serious, and sometimes
irreverent, it is a compelling manifesto: for re-imagining
spaces for these times and facing up to their
challenge.</p>},

This book presents a selection of Donald B. Rubin's research articles on matched sampling, from the early 1970s, when the author was one of the major researchers involved in establishing the field, to recent contributions to this now extremely active area. The articles include fundamental theoretical studies that have become classics, important extensions, and real applications that range from breast cancer treatments to tobacco litigation to studies of criminal tendencies. They are organized into seven parts, each with an introduction by the author that provides historical and personal context and discusses the relevance of the work today. A concluding essay offers advice to investigators designing observational studies. The book provides an accessible introduction to the study of matched sampling and will be an indispensable reference for students and researchers in statistics, epidemiology, medicine, economics, education, sociology, political science, and anyone else doing empirical research to evaluate the causal effects of interventions. },

This paper deals with balancing groups with respect to prognostic factors in clinical trials, as a means of increasing the power of a study. We use the Mantel-Haenszel statistic to obtain a simple measure for assessing the relative efficiency of different factors for stratification and to find optimal cutpoints for the given factors. For any available database, the measure can be used to construct optimal strata for a clinical trial. The paper also presents a practical approach for reducing the number of strata using discriminant regions with a method of assessing the effectiveness of this approach. An example from a large database of severe head trauma patients illustrates the utility of the measure.},

	Abstract = {Without a doubt, there has been a ``credibility revolution'' in applied econometrics. One contributing development has been in the improvement and increased use in data analysis of ``structural methods''; that is, the use of models based in economic theory. Structural modeling attempts to use data to identify the parameters of an underlying economic model, based on models of individual choice or aggregate relations derived from them. Structural estimation has a long tradition in economics, but better and larger data sets, more powerful computers, improved modeling methods, faster computational techniques, and new econometric methods such as those mentioned above have allowed researchers to make significant improvements. While Angrist and Pischke extol the successes of empirical work that estimates ``treatment effects'' based on actual or quasi-experiments, they are much less sanguine about structural analysis and hold industrial organization up as an example where ``progress is less dramatic},

	Abstract = {A general method for constructing permutation tests for
various experimental designs follows from invariance and
sufficiency. In this framework, randomization (or
rerandomization) tests are just special cases of
permutation tests. The methodology extends the
applicability of permutation tests: An example demonstrates
a test for an interaction effect in a factorial experiment,
a problem thought to be unapproachable by permutation or
randomization methods. Tests are constructed as follows.
The modeling of block and treatment effects closely
parallels classical analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA
assumptions of iid normal random errors are replaced,
however, by the much weaker assumption of exchangeability
of subsets of random errors. Distributional dependences on
the unknown nuisance parameters for blocks, covariates, and
untested treatments and on the unknown error distribution
are eliminated by invariance and sufficiency, respectively.
Initial reduction of the data by invariance appears to
extend considerably the applicability of permutation tests.
Because of the assumed exchangeability of the errors, the
sufficiency step leads to data permutations when computing
the test. The method also addresses some philosophical
problems associated with randomization tests. For instance,
in this article's framework, it is the design, and not the
data, which is always regarded as fixed, so ancillarity of
the design causes no difficulty.},

is indispensable and fundamental to all science; (2) The
controversial issues are not latent in the concept of
causality itself, but in certain questionable hypotheses,
so-called \{"\}laws of causality,\{"\} such as the universal
scope of causality, the certainty (irrevocability) of a
cause-effect relationship, the connection of causality with
theories of induction, the principles of determinism and
freedom of the will, etc; (3) A definition of causality
which seems to be adequate from both common-sense and
scientific points of view is suggested with reference to
the well-known situation of the controlled experiment; (4)
Some general remarks on statistical methods from the
viewpoint of the dual distinction between descriptive and
explanatory analysis and between experimental and
nonexperimental observations are made; (5-6) Some comments

of inference used here relates Bayesian inference to
algorithmic information theory. Simplicity is examined in
the light of induction, the Duhem-Quine thesis, and bounded
rationality. The second issue relates to the role that
simplicity might play in econometric modelling. This is

In opposition to this view, it is argued that a well-designed empirical study reaches conclusions that tend to replicate when correct and are less likely to replicate when incorrect, whereas in a poorly designed study the conclusions tend to replicate even when incorrect. In observational studies of treatment effects, the same hidden bias may occur repeatedly in a series of studies, so the studies reproduce the same distorted estimates of treatment effects. The purpose of this article is to point to strategies in research design that make it less likely that biased estimates will replicate, and to illustrate these strategies with examples. To replicate effects without replicating biases, vary the treatment assignment mechanism, so that the reasons subjects are spared treatment are different in the original and replicated studies. Also, vary the treatment envelope-that is, the ostensibly irrelevant features in which the treatment is packaged.},

@unpublished{BoweHans:Polmeth:2005,
	Abstract = {Statistical analysis requires a probability model: commonly, a model for the dependence of outcomes Y on confounders X and a potentially causal variable Z. When the goal of the analysis is to infer Z's effects on Y , this requirement introduces an element of circularity: in order to decide how Z affects Y , the analyst first determines, speculatively, the manner of Y 's dependence on Z and other variables. This paper takes a statistical perspective that avoids such circles, permitting analysis of Z's effects on Y even as the statistician remains entirely agnostic about the conditional distribution of Y given X and Z, or perhaps even denies that such a distribution exists. Our assumptions instead pertain to the conditional distribution Z|X, and the role of speculation in settling them is reduced by the use of such techniques as propensity scores, poststratification, testing for overt bias before accepting a poststratification, and optimal full matching. Such beginnings pave the way for ``randomization inference'', an approach which, despite a long history in the analysis of designed experiments, is relatively new to political science and to other fields in which experimental data are rarely available. The approach applies to both experiments and observational studies. We illustrate this by applying it to analyze A. Gerber and D. Green's New Haven Vote 98 campaign. Conceived as both a get-out-the-vote campaign and a field experiment in political participation, the campaign as it turned out was in some ways more similar to an observational study than to a randomized experiment. Our analysis uses the strengths of the design of their study while adjusting for irregularities ignored by the original analysis. We estimate the number of voters who would not have voted had the campaign not prompted them to --- that is, the total number of votes attributable to the interventions of the campaigners. Both our statistical inferences about these attributable effects and the stratification and matching that precede them rely on quite recent developments from statistics; our matching, in particular, has novel features of potentially wide applicability. Our broad findings resemble those of the original analysis by Gerber and Green (2000), although in the small, the method offers additional information as to the campaign's effects upon interestingly different subgroups, such as older voters or those who have not voted in a previous election. },

Under certain conditions, the extended definition is shown to preserve a repeated sampling property that a practitioner expects from exact confidence intervals. The proposed procedure is also applied to the problem of constructing confidence intervals for the difference in two exponential means and for variance components in mixed models. A repeated sampling property of generalized p values is also given. With this characterization one can carry out fixed level tests of parameters of continuous distributions on the basis of generalized p values. Finally, Pratt's paradox is revisited, and a procedure that resolves the paradox is given.},

	Abstract = {An effect is attributable to treatment if it would not have been observed had the individual been exposed to control instead. Extending earlier results on attributable effects in unmatched groups, a method of exact randomization inference and sensitivity analysis is developed for case-referent, case-crossover, and cohort studies with matched sets, and a large sample approximation to the exact inference is given. The unmatched case, considered previously, has certain symmetries that the matched case, considered here, does not have. As a result, approximation for the matched case requires the use of the recently developed method of asymptotic separability, which was riot needed in the unmatched case. Several examples are presented, including a case-referent study of Helicobacter pylori infection as a cause of myocardial infarction, a case-crossover study of alcohol as a cause of injury, a cohort study of women who gave birth at home, and a study of the effects of cadmium exposure with a continuous outcome measuring kidney function. Unlike tests of no effect, inference about attributable effects has a different form in case-referent and cohort studies.},

@article{Hsu2013,
	Abstract = {In an observational study of treatment effects, subjects are not randomly assigned to treatment or control, so differing outcomes in treated and control groups may reflect a bias from nonrandom assignment rather than a treatment effect. After adjusting for measured pretreatment covariates, perhaps by matching, a sensitivity analysis determines the magnitude of bias from an unmeasured covariate that would need to be present to alter the conclusions of the naive analysis that presumes adjustments eliminated all bias. Other things being equal, larger effects tend to be less sensitive to bias than smaller effects. Effect modification is an interaction between a treatment and a pretreatment covariate controlled by matching, so that the treatment effect is larger at some values of the covariate than at others. In the presence of effect modification, it is possible that results are less sensitive to bias in subgroups experiencing larger effects. Two cases are considered: (i) an a priori grouping into a few categories based on covariates controlled by matching and (ii) a grouping discovered empirically in the data at hand. In case (i), subgroup specific bounds on p-values are combined using the truncated product of p-values. In case (ii), information that is fixed under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect is used to partition matched pairs in the hope of identifying pairs with larger effects. The methods are evaluated using an asymptotic device, the design sensitivity, and using simulation. Sensitivity analysis for a test of the global null hypothesis of no effect is converted to sensitivity analyses for subgroup analyses using closed testing. A study of an intervention to control malaria in Africa is used to illustrate.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory. The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

	Abstract = {In observational studies of treatment effects, matched samples have$\backslash$ntraditionally been constructed using two tools, namely close matches$\backslash$non one or two key covariates and close matches on the propensity$\backslash$nscore to stochastically balance large numbers of covariates. Here$\backslash$nwe propose a third tool, fine balance, obtained using the assignment$\backslash$nalgorithm in a new way. We use all three tools to construct a matched$\backslash$nsample for an ongoing study of provider specialty in the treatment$\backslash$nof ovarian cancer. Fine balance refers to exact balance of a nominal$\backslash$ncovariate, often one with many categories, but it does not require$\backslash$nindividually matched treated and control subjects for this variable.$\backslash$nIn the example the nominal variable has 72 = 9 x 8 categories formed$\backslash$nfrom 9 possible years of diagnosis and 8 geographic locations or$\backslash$nSEER sites. We obtain exact balance on the 72 categories and close$\backslash$nindividual matches on clinical stage, grade, year of diagnosis, and$\backslash$nother variables using a distance, and stochastically balance a total$\backslash$nof 61 covariates using a propensity score. Our approach finds an$\backslash$noptimal match that minimizes a suitable distance subject to the constraint$\backslash$nthat fine balance is achieved. This is done by defining a special$\backslash$npatterned distance matrix and passing it to a subroutine that solves$\backslash$nthe optimal assignment problem, which optimally pairs the rows and$\backslash$ncolumns of a matrix using a polynomial time algorithm. In the example$\backslash$nwe used the function Proc Assign in SAS. A new theorem shows that$\backslash$nwith our patterned distance matrix, the assignment algorithm returns$\backslash$nan optimal, finely balanced matched sample whenever one exists, and$\backslash$notherwise returns an infinite distance, indicating that no such matched$\backslash$nsample exists.},

We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.},

@article{Fran:1989,
	Abstract = {Theories demand much of data, often more than a single data collection can provide. For example, many important research questions are set in the past and must rely on data collected at that time and for other purposes. As a result, we often find that the data lack crucial variables. Another common problem arises when we wish to estimate the relationship between variables that are measured in different data sets. A variation of this occurs with a split half sample design in which one or more important variables appear on the ``wrong'' half. Finally, we may need panel data but have only cross sections available. In each of these cases our ability to estimate the theoretically determined equation is limited by the data that are available. In many cases there is simply no solution, and theory must await new opportunities for testing. Under certain circumstances, however, we may still be able to estimate relationships between variables even though they are not measured on the same set of observations. This technique, which I call two-stage auxiliary instrumental variables (2SAIV), provides some new leverage on such problems and offers the opportunity to test hypotheses that were previously out of reach. This article develops the 2SAIV estimator, proves its consistency and derives its asymptotic variance. A set of simulations illustrates the performance of the estimator in finite samples and several applications are sketched out.

application include comparisons of age-adjusted death

applications as appropriate. Extensions in form involve
considering multiple contingency tables with arbitrarily
many rows and/or columns, where rows and columns are
orderable, and may even be on a continuous scale. The
assignment of some score for each row or column is
essential to use of the method. With scores assigned, a
deviation of the sum of cross products from expectation,
and its variance conditioned on all marginal totals, are
computed for each table and a chi square is determined
corresponding to the grand total of the deviations. For
various specific instances and for various scoring
procedures, the procedure extends or is equivalent to the
asymptotic form of many known nonparametric techniques.},

	Abstract = {I do think, however, that if youre in the early phase of your career as a graduate student in, say, Sociology, or Economics, or Political Science, you should give some thought to how youre going to organize and manage your work. This is so for two reasons. First, the transition to graduate school is a good time to make changes. Early on, theres less inertia and cost associated with switching things around than there will be later. Second, in the social sciences, text and data management skills are usually not taught to students explicitly. This means that you may end up adopting the practices of your advisor or mentor, continue to use what you are taught in your methods classes, or just copy whatever your peers are doing. Following these paths may lead you to an arrangement that you will be happy with. But maybe not. Its worth looking at the options.},

	Abstract = {Analyses of social network data have suggested that obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness all travel through social networks. Individuals exert ``contagion effects'' on one another through social ties and association. These analyses have come under critique because of the possibility that homophily from unmeasured factors may explain these statistical associations and because similar findings can be obtained when the same methodology is applied to height, acne, and headaches, for which the conclusion of contagion effects seems somewhat less plausible. The author uses sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the extent to which supposed contagion effects for obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness might be explained away by homophily or confounding and the extent to which the critique using analysis of data on height, acne, and headaches is relevant. Sensitivity analyses suggest that contagion effects for obesity and smoking cessation are reasonably robust to possible latent homophily or environmental confounding; those for happiness and loneliness are somewhat less so. Supposed effects for height, acne, and headaches are all easily explained away by latent homophily and confounding. The methodology that has been used in past studies for contagion effects in social networks, when used in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, may prove useful in establishing social influence for various behaviors and states. The sensitivity analysis approach can be used to address the critique of latent homophily as a possible explanation of associations interpreted as contagion effects.},

Such utopian thinking is indispensable, and contributing to it is part of sociology's core business. This article illustrates these claims by considering one particular utopian proposal: an unconditional basic income paid to every member of society on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. It summarizes the main arguments that support this proposal, mentions a number of contexts in which it is being taken seriously, and sketches a number of ways in which sociological insights and research are crucially relevant to the discussion of the economic and political sustainability of an unconditional basic income.},

@article{cox90trs,
	Abstract = {The formal theory of statistical analysis depends on the
abstractions that the data are observed values of random
variables, that a family of probability distributions (a
model) has, at least tentatively, been formulated and that
the objective of the analysis is connected in some way with
the underlying `true' distribution. These ideas, while very
powerful, are idealizations and in particular the choice of
the model is of critical importance. In addition, many
challenging aspects of applied statistics are, of course,
concerned with such issues as the meaning and quality of
data, and the interpretation of carefully chosen tables and
graphs, matters where the probabilistic aspect is barely
visible. It is argued that, while the recognition of this
is important, the moral is not that descriptive statistics
should be separated from probabilistic statistics, but
rather that the common ground should be explored; what is
the formal theory underlying descriptive methods and how
can the results of analyses based on elaborate theory be
presented in a striking and easily understood way? There
are various aspects to the choice of models. A first
distinction is between primary aspects, which in effect
serve to define the aspects of substantive interest, and
secondary aspects which complete the specification and
which thereby indicate appropriate efficient methods of
analysis and how to calculate measures of uncertainty.
Often, but not necessarily, the latter concern assumptions
of distributional shape and of independence; they are
secondary not in the sense of being unimportant but rather
in not being the primary focus of substantive interest.
Models, especially in their primary aspects, are of three
broad types, substantive (i.e. based on special
subject-matter knowledge or theory), empirical representing
usually smooth dependencies without any strong
subject-matter input and indirect models which are useful,
for example, for calibration of descriptive methods. All
three types can be subdivided in various ways; see Cox
(1990). These ideas were illustrated in some detail by
discussing various kinds of model for precipitation, for
example hourly rainfalls, and by the issues involved in
predicting the AIDS epidemic. The importance of interplay
between substantive and empirical ideas was emphasized.},

units of analysis, one nested within the other. Such data
are becoming quite common in political science and provide
numerous opportunities for theory testing and development.
Unfortunately, this type of data typically generates a
number of statistical problems, of which clustering is
particularly important. To exploit the opportunities
offered by multilevel data, and to solve the statistical
problems inherent in them, special statistical techniques
are required. In this article, we focus on a technique that
has become popular in educational statistics and
sociology-multilevel analysis. In multilevel analysis,
researchers build models that capture the layered structure
of multilevel data, and determine how layers interact and
impact a dependent variable of interest. Our objective in
this article is to introduce the logic and statistical
theory behind multilevel models, to illustrate how such
models can be applied fruitfully in political science, and
to call attention to some of the pitfalls in multilevel
analysis.},

We analyze the following prob- lem: given a threshold for the minimum number of units to be contained in a block, and given a distance measure between any two units in the finite population, block the units so that the maximum distance between any two units within a block is minimized. This blocking criterion can minimize covariate imbalance, which is a common goal in experimental design. Find- ing an optimal blocking is an NP-hard problem. However, using ideas from graph theory, we provide the first polynomial time approximately optimal blocking algorithm for this problem. We derive the variances of estimators for sample average treatment effects under the Neyman-Rubin potential out- comes model for arbitrary blocking assignments and an arbitrary number of treatments.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is usually administered by medical oncologists (MOs) or gynecologic oncologists (GOs). GOs perform a broad spectrum of surgical and medical activities while managing a limited number of diseases; MOs specialize in the administration of chemotherapy but manage a broad array of diseases. We asked whether survival, treatment, and toxicity differed according to the type of specialist providing the chemotherapy after surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)--Medicare data for patients 65 years old from 1991 through 2001 from eight SEER sites, we identified 344 patients with ovarian cancer who were treated with chemotherapy by a GO after surgery. Using optimal matching and propensity scores based on 36 characteristics, we matched these patients to 344 similar patients who were operated on and staged by the same type of surgeon but who received chemotherapy from an MO. RESULTS: MOs administered chemotherapy over more weeks than did the GOs (16.5 v 12.1 weeks, respectively; P < .0023), and MO patients had substantially more weeks that included chemotherapy-associated adverse events than GO patients (16.2 v 8.9 weeks, respectively; P < .0001). However, there was no difference in 5-year survival rate between the GO and MO groups (35\% v 34\%, respectively; P = .45). CONCLUSION: GO- and MO-treated patients who were closely matched on prognostic characteristics experienced very different rates of chemotherapy-associated adverse events and very different chemotherapy treatment styles by specialty type; however, their survival was virtually identical.},

It first develops several techniques for data exploration for outliers and outlier analysis and then applies these to the detailed analysis of outliers in two large scale multilevel data sets from educational contexts. The techniques include the use of deviance reduction, measures based on residuals, leverage values, hierarchical cluster analysis and a measure called DFITS. Outlier analysis is more complex in a multilevel data set than in, say, a univariate sample or a set of regression data, where the concept of an outlying value is straightforward. In the multilevel situation one has to consider, for example, at what level or levels a particular response is outlying, and in respect of which explanatory variables; furthermore, the treatment of a particular response at one level may affect its status or the status of other units at other levels in the model.},

Questioning the theoretical centrality of this assumption directs social movement analysis away from its heavy emphasis upon the social psychology of social movement participants; it can then be more easily integrated with structural theories of social process. This essay presents a set of concepts and related propositions drawn from a resource mobilization perspective. It emphasizes the variety and sources of resources; the relationship of social movements to the media, authorities, and other parties; and the interaction among movement organizations. Propositions are developed to explain social movement activity at several levels of inclusiveness-the social movement sector, the social movement industry, and social movement organization.},

	Abstract = {When leaders and citizens in the United States articulate their core political beliefs, they often do so in terms of parenthood and family. But while the motives might be admirable, the results of such thinking are often corrosive to our democratic goals. In The Parent as Citizen, Brian Duff reveals how efforts to make the experience of parenthood inform citizenship contribute to the most persistent problems in modern democracy and democratic theory.
Duff explains how influential theories of democratic citizenship rely on the metaphor of parenthood to help individuals rise to the challenges of politics, and demonstrates that this reliance has unintended consequences. When parenthood is imagined to instill confidence in political virtue, it uncovers insecurity. When parenthood is believed to inculcate openness to change, it produces fundamentalism. Duff develops this argument through original readings of four theorists of citizenship: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Rorty, and Cornel West-readings that engage the ways in which these theorists incorporated their personal history into their political thought.
In showing how problems that plagued canonical theorists of citizenship still trouble contemporary thinkers and citizens alike, Duff's insights are deeply relevant to present-day politics.},

Covariance adjustment can reduce bias in the estimate of the treatment effect (Cochran \& Rubin, 1973); however, baseline group differences with respect to unobserved covariates which cannot be controlled can lead to hidden bias. This article presents a simple method which uses omitted variable bias to assess the uncertainty of the hidden bias by describing what scenarios regarding the unobserved covariate can lead to a given level of hidden bias. A comparison of a culturally sensitive AIDS video education program and a standard AIDS video education program is used as an illustration.},

They emphasize the rise of experiments and quasi-experiments as credible sources of identification in microeconometric studies, which they usefully term ``design-based research.'' But in so doing, they miss an important part of the story: a second research strand aimed at developing tools for inference that are robust to subsidiary modeling assumptions. My first aim in these remarks therefore is to highlight some key developments in this area. I then turn to Angrist and Pischke's call for adopting experiments and quasi-experiments in macroeconometrics; while sympathetic, I suspect the scope for such studies is limited. I conclude with some observations on the current debate about whether experimental methods have gone too far in abandoning economic theory. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
